{% include image.html src="/assets/img/hrb/HRB Example.gif"
   alt="TCM transparent button.gif"
   style="float: left; width: 75%; margin: .25rem 1rem 1rem 0px;"
   caption="Hyperlink Recipe Baker Example"
%}

**Runs in your browser!**

Just click a few buttons to paste clipboard contents into the 
*Hyperlink Recipe Baker*, or **HRB** for short, ingredient fields.

Then select one of
the "Bake" options for a Hyperlink in ***HTML*** or  ***Markdown*** 
format. The "baked recipe" is put into your clipboard.

Then switch to your document and paste the clipboard contents with
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>. 

Each time you use it, **HRB** saves you from 
googling the hyperlink syntax, typing text and confused head scratching.

   alt="TCM transparent button.gif"
   style="float: left; width: 75%; margin: .25rem 1rem 1rem 0px;"
   caption="The Cookie Machine Buttons"

*The Cookie Machine*, commonly abbreviated as **TCM**,
is accessed using a transparent button at the top of
every {{ site.title }} web page.

TCM is new technology that repurposes "Cookies". Cookies
were historically used to track your activity on the
the internet. With TCM they are now tools you can use to
save, share and quickly import configurations from other
browsers and other devices.

Development began on February 25, 2022 and should take 
about six months to complete.

the command line or a Desktop Shortcut that calls `mt`.

## Music Player with CD encoding, lyrics scraping and synchronization

{% include image.html src="/assets/img/mserve/mserve small demo.gif"
   alt="mserve small demo"
   style="float: left; width: 80%; margin: 0em 1rem 1rem 0px;"
%}

This short `.gif` video clip, with no sound, shows one third
of the main `mserve` music player window.

You can download and modify the source code to your own tastes.

Features like encoding CDs using automatic internet
lookup for album tracks, artwork and song lyrics make
`mserve` a "do everything" Music Player.

From your local PC you can access music stored on your
File Server or Cell Phone and play it locally without
transferring all the songs.  **SSH** is used to mount
the remote drives as local partitions.

> **NOTE:** This program is still under development and may require extra steps to install any missing python module dependencies.
>  
> Some dependency examples are: `tk`, `ttkwidgets`, `pil`, `ffmpeg`, `libdiscid`, `musicbrainzngs`, `requests`, `magic`, `mutagen` and `beautifulsoup`.
