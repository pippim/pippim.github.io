## Hyperlink Recipe Baker App

<!-- Dummy div required for <a href...> to work for clicking -->
<div>
<a href="programs/hyperlink.html">
   {% include image.html src="/assets/img/hrb/HRB Example.gif"
      alt="TCM transparent button.gif"
      style="float: left; width: 75%; margin: .25rem 1rem 1rem 0px;"
      caption="Hyperlink Recipe Baker Example"
   %}
</a>
</div>

**HRB runs in your browser!** - No programs to install or configure.

Just click a few buttons to paste clipboard contents into the 
*Hyperlink Recipe Baker*, or **HRB** for short, ingredient fields.

Then select one of
the "Bake" options for a Hyperlink in ***HTML*** or  ***Markdown*** 
format. The "baked recipe" is put into your clipboard.

Then switch to your document and paste the clipboard contents with
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>. 

Each time you use it, **HRB** saves you from 
googling the hyperlink syntax, typing text and confused head scratching.

browsers and other devices.

Development began on February 25, 2022 and should take 
about six months to complete.

Using `cdd` - a Change Directory (`cd`) Power Tool, will save you time
and annoyance. 

`cdd` is a small Bash script you can easily drop into your
terminal startup file (`~/.bashrc`) or put into a bash script file 
within your path. It uses the `zenity` GUI from the console. `zenity`
is available in most distributions.

The [small `cdd` bash script ðŸ”—](https://askubuntu.com/a/1276376/307523 
"Open Ask Ubuntu Answer containing the `cdd` bash script"){:target="_blank"}
is stored in an *Ask Ubuntu* answer post.

### Simple To Use:
{:.no_toc}

- Type `cdd` and automatically go down one directory if only one 
sub-directory exists.

- Type `cdd` and then a list of sub-directories appears in a nifty
GUI window. Type a letter and the lists scrolls to the group of 
sub-directories names that begin with that letter.

- To select an entry in the sub-directory list, double-click on 
the entry or use arrow keys to highlight and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

<!-- Dummy div required for <a href...> to work for clicking -->
<div>
<a href="programs/mserve.html">
   {% include image.html src="/assets/img/mserve/mserve small demo.gif"

of the main `mserve` music player window.

Features like encoding CDs using automatic internet

`mserve` a "do everything" Music Player.

From your local PC you can access music stored on your
File Server or Cell Phone and play it locally without
transferring all the songs.  **SSH** is used to mount
the remote drives as local partitions.

>  
> Some dependency examples are: `tk`, `ttkwidgets`, `pil`, `ffmpeg`, `libdiscid`, `musicbrainzngs`, `requests`, `magic`, `mutagen` and `beautifulsoup`.
