## Music Player with CD encoding, lyrics scraping and synchronization

{% include image.html src="/assets/img/mserve/mserve small demo.gif"
   alt="mserve small demo"
   style="float: left; width: 82%; margin: 0em 1em 1em 0px;"

This short little video clip shows a subset of the main `mserve`
music player window.

The full source code is available for you to download and
modify to your own tastes.

Features like encoding CDs using automatic internet
lookup for album tracks, artwork and song lyrics make
`mserve` a "do everything" Music Player.

From your local PC you can access musics stored on your
File Server or Cell Phone and play it locally without
transferring the songs first.  **SSH** is used to mount
the remote drives as local partitions.

< **NOTE:** This program is still under development and  
< requires extra steps to install dependencies if they  
< are not already on your system.
