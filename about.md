<a id="how-was-pippim-created?"></a>
## How was Pippim created?

*"How"* doesn't begin with a "W", which seems to contradict the 
"5 W's" but, as the saying goes:

> Who, What, Where, When, Why *and sometimes How*

So how as Pippim created? Well the
first step was to find a domain name (website name) that:

1. Was easy to remember
2. Was six characters or less
3. Was two syllables or less
4. Could be typed with the right hand only
5. Did not contain special characters like "-" or digits like "9", "0", etc.
6. Ended with the extension ".com" instead of ".net" or ".org", etc.
7. Wasn't a name already reserved and being sold for thousands of dollars
8. Could be purchased from Google Domains which offers good security, performance and reliability

After finding out the name "pippim.com" was available, a few more weeks
of contemplation went by, before *"pulling the trigger"*, and buying the
name for $17 CAD per year.

Then this Pippim website was created using 
GitHub Pages for free. More details about how the website
was created can be found on in the middle of the
[Home Page](https://pippim.github.io/#github-pages).
