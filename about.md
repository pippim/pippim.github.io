## Who is Pippim?

Pippim is a one-man-show that has been answering questions since 2016 
on AskUbuntu.com under the awkard name of "WinEunuuchs2Unix". When you 
look at
**[WinEnuuchs2Unix's profile](https://askubuntu.com/users/307523/wineunuuchs2unix)**
in Ask Ubuntu you will see the image on the right.

At the time the "WinEunuuchs2Unix" name was created,
 the intention was to signal 
abaondoning MicroSoft Windows for the open-source world of Linux (Unix). That said,
Windows is undeniably the go-to platform for Governements, Corporations and most 
individuals in the world. No doubt most people who actually make money in the
Linux World still use Windows from time to time.

## What is Pippim?

Pippim is a website providing free and open source computer software primarily for
use on Linux. The focus is mostly on Ubutnu but, nowdaays some of the solutions
work on 
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) as
well.

Pippim has no business model for making money today. You will find no user tracking,
no ads and no spamming. Maybe someday Pippim will make money but in the meantime it
is simply a labour of love.

## Where is Pippim located?

Figuratively speaking, Pippim is located in "the clouds" on Google Sites and
Github Pages. As you may have astutely spotted in the screen shot in the
*Who is Pippim* section above though, 
Pippim is physically located in Edmonton, Canada. Tonight (November 21, 2021 at
8:30pm MST), as the map for Edmonton shows, it is cool but not cold. It's only
one degree below freezing as the little yellow dot highlights.

## When was Pippim created?

That's an easy question; The Domain Name and website was created October 16, 2021.
Initially www.pippim.com was quickly created on Google Sites. Then the
[main Pippim Website](pippim.github.io) (don't click the link because you are
already here!) was created much slower on Gikhub Pages. Many revisions were 
made -- 630 commits (revisions) and still counting as of November 21, 2021.

## Why was Pippim created?

It's common practice to create websites to make money. That isn't why Pippim 
was created though.
Pippim was created to make it easier to list the free software created on 
the websites [AskUbuntu](www.askubuntu.com) and [Github](www.github.com).
Pippim Posts which are 92% Answers and 8% Questions, have over **52 million
views** as of November 22, 2021. With over 2,000 answers, 
managing them on 
a Pippim website just makes sense.

Of course we all need money and maybe someday Pippim will earn revenue,
open an office in Silicon Valley and hire some employees. But in the
meantime, Pippim is strictly a labour of love (yes that was already 
said earlier).

## How was Pippim created?

Yes this is the 6th section which contradicts the "5 W's". Additionally,
"How" doesn't begin with a "W" which also seems to contradict the "5 W's" but,
as the saying goes:

> Who, What, Where, When, Why *and sometimes How*

So how as Pippin created? Well the
first step was to find a domain name (website name) that:

1. Was easy to remember
2. Was six characters or less
3. Was two syllables or less
4. Could be typed with the right hand only
5. Did not contain special characters like "-" or digits like "9", "0", etc.
6. Ended with the extension ".com" instead of ".net" or ".org", etc.
7. Wasn't a name already reserved and being sold for thousands of dollars
8. Could be purchased from Google Domains which offers good security, performance and reliability

After finding out that the "pippim.com" was available, more weeks of contemplation 
went by before "pulling the trigger" and buying the name for $17 CAD per year.

Then the `www.pippim.com` website was created using Google Sites for free.

Then the `pippim.github.io` website was created using Github Pages for free.

### Hopefully you enjoy the freedom! :)
