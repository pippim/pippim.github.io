It's located on the cloud in Google Sites and Github Pages. As you may
have spotted int the screen shot in *Who is Pippim*,

## When was Pippim created?

That's an easy question; The Domain Name and website was created October 16, 2021.
Initially www.pippim.com was quickly created on Google Sites. Then the
[main Pippim Website](pippim.github.io) (don't click the link because you are
already here!) was created much slower on Gikhub Pages. Many revisions were 
made -- 630 commits (revisions) and still counting as of November 21, 2021.

## Why was Pippim created?

It's common practice to create websites to make money. That isn't why Pippim 
was created though.
Pippim was created to make it easier to list the free software created on 
the websites [AskUbuntu](www.askubuntu.com) and [Github](www.github.com).
Pippim Posts which are 70% Answers and 30% Questions, have over **51 million** 
views as of November 8, 2021. With over 2,000 answers, managing them on 
a managing them on a Pippim website just makes sense.

Of course we all need money and maybe someday Pippim will earn revenue and
hire employees. But in the meantime, Pippim is strictly a labour of love.

## How was Pippim created?

Yes this is the sixth section. And yes "How" doesn't begin with a "W". But as they say:

> Who, What, Where, When, Why and sometimes How

The first step was to find a domain name (website name) that:

1. Was easy to remember
2. Was six characters or less
3. Was two syllables or less
4. Could be typed with the right hand only
5. Did not contain special characters like "-" or digits like "9", "0", etc.
6. Ended with the extension ".com" instead of ".net" or ".org", etc.
7. Wasn't a name already reserved and being sold for thousands of dollars
8. Could be purchased from Google Domains which offers good security, performance and reliability

After finding out that the name "pippim" was available, more weeks of contemplation 
went by before "pulling the trigger" and buying "pippim.com" for $17 CAD per year.

Then the `www.pippim.com` website was created using Google Sites for free.

Then the `pippim.github.io` website was created using Github Pages for free.

### Hopefully you enjoy the freedom! :)
