# About Pippim

This page answers questions you might have about Pippim. This page
addresses the **5 W's**; "Who", "What", Where", When and "Why"
of Pippim. On this page you will discover:

## Who is Pippim?

Pippim is a one-man-show that has been answering questions since 2016 
on AskUbuntu.com under the awkard name of "WinEunuuchs2Unix". When you 
look at
**[WinEnuuchs2Unix's profile](https://askubuntu.com/users/307523/wineunuuchs2unix)**
in Ask Ubuntu you will see the image on the right.

At the time the "WinEunuuchs2Unix" name was created,
 the intention was to signal 
abaondoning MicroSoft Windows for the open-source world of Linux (Unix). That said,
Windows is undeniably the go-to platform for Governements, Corporations and most 
individuals in the world. No doubt most people who actually make money in the
Linux World still use Windows from time to time.

## What is Pippim?

Pippim is a website providing free and open source computer software primarily for
use on Linux. The focus is mostly on Ubutnu but, nowdaays some of the solutions
work on 
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) as
well.

Pippim has no business model for making money today. You will find no user tracking,
no ads and no spamming. Maybe someday Pippim will make money but in the meantime it
is simply a labour of love.

## Where is Pippim located?

Figuratively speaking, Pippim is located in "the clouds" on 
[Google Sites](https://pippim.com) (https://pippim.com) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/pippim/pippim.github.io)
(https://github.com/pippim/pippim.github.io) where all the 
source code is kept. The website you are viewing now is found
on [GitHub Pages](https://pippim.github.io) 
(https://pippim.github.io). All three websites are hosted
for free by the providers. Other than the cost of time to 
learn web design, I can't how cheap the process has been!

As you may have deduced by the little yellow dot in this image
though, Pippim is physically located in Edmonton, Canada. 
For a better view, right click on the picture, select
"Open in new tab" and then zoom in with your browser.
This afternoon (December 7, 2021 at 5:46pm MST), as the
map for Edmonton shows, it is chilly at 6 degrees below
freezing. Obviously most people in Edmonton are happy for 
global warming and not climate change. Sorry Greta :/

## When was Pippim created?

That's an easy question; The Domain Name and website was created October 16, 2021.
Initially www.pippim.com was quickly created on Google Sites. Then the
[main Pippim Website](pippim.github.io) (don't click the link because you are
already here!) was created much slower on GitHhub Pages. Many revisions were 
made -- 1,020 commits (revisions) and still counting as of December 5, 2021.

<a id="why-was-pippim-created?"></a>
## Why was Pippim created?

Pippim was created to make it easier to list the free software created on 
the websites [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com).
Pippim Posts which are 95% Answers and 5% Questions, have over **{{ site.views_human }}
views** as of {{ site.refreshed | date: "%B %e, %Y" }}. With over 2,000 answers, 
managing them on a Pippim website just makes sense.

It's common practice to create websites to make money. That isn't why Pippim 
was created though.
Of course we all need money and maybe someday Pippim will earn revenue,
open an office in Silicon Valley and hire some employees. But in the
meantime, Pippim is strictly a labour of love (yes that was already 
said earlier). It would not be unfair to classify Pippim as *"Software
Development as a Hobby"*.

<a id="how-was-pippim-created?"></a>
## How was Pippim created?

Yes this is the 6th section which contradicts the "5 W's". Additionally,
"How" doesn't begin with a "W" which also seems to contradict the "5 W's" but,
as the saying goes:

> Who, What, Where, When, Why *and sometimes How*

So how as Pippin created? Well the
first step was to find a domain name (website name) that:

1. Was easy to remember
2. Was six characters or less
3. Was two syllables or less
4. Could be typed with the right hand only
5. Did not contain special characters like "-" or digits like "9", "0", etc.
6. Ended with the extension ".com" instead of ".net" or ".org", etc.
7. Wasn't a name already reserved and being sold for thousands of dollars
8. Could be purchased from Google Domains which offers good security, performance and reliability

After finding out that the "pippim.com" was available, more weeks of contemplation 
went by before "pulling the trigger" and buying the name for $17 CAD per year.

Then the [www.pippim.com website](https://pippim.com) was
created using Google Sites for free.

Next the [pippim.github.io website](https://pippim.github.io) (Don't bother
clicking the link as you are here now!) was created using 
GitHub Pages for free. More details about how the website
was created can be found on in the middle of the
[Home Page](https://pippim.github.io/#how-the-table-of-contents-is-generated).

### Hopefully you enjoy the freedom! :)
