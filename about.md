## What is Pippim?

Pippim is a website with free and open source software.

The software is primarily for use on Linux. There are also
free on-line apps you can use in your browser.

Pippim website features:

- Tim-ta project timer
- HRB website links 
- Fast search engine
- Day and night themes
- Scrape Stack Exchange
- No ads or cookies

Tim-ta project timer sounds an alarm
at each step of your project. It runs
in your browser.

HRB (Hyperlink Recipe Baker) also runs
in your browser. Use it to quickly
create hyperlinks for the documentation
you write.

The Pippim website is designed for you to copy it
(fork on GitHub Pages) and create your own
website. To speed up the process, variables
such as the name "Pippim" only needs to be
changed in one place. Then hundreds or thousands
of pages are automatically updated.

## Where is Pippim located?

Figuratively speaking, Pippim is located in "the clouds" on 
[Google Sites ðŸ”—](https://pippim.com) (https://pippim.com) and
[GitHub ðŸ”—](https://github.com/pippim/pippim.github.io)
(https://github.com/pippim/pippim.github.io) where all the 
source code is kept. The website you are viewing now is found
on [GitHub Pages ðŸ”—](https://pippim.github.io) 
(https://pippim.github.io). All three websites are hosted
for free by the providers. Other than the cost of time to 
learn web design, I can't believe how cheap the process has been!

As you may have deduced by the little yellow dot in this image
though, Pippim is physically located in Edmonton, Canada. 
For a better view, right-click on the picture, select
*Open in new tab*, and then zoom in with your browser.
On January 26, 2022, after long bouts of cold weather, it is
surprisingly warm in Edmonton.

created on October 16, 2021.
Initially, www.pippim.com was created on Google Sites.

the website was moved to GitHub Pages.

## How was Pippim created?

*"How"* doesn't begin with a "W", which seems to contradict the 
"5 W's" but, as the saying goes:

> Who, What, Where, When, Why *and sometimes How*

So how as Pippim created? Well the
first step was to find a domain name (website name) that:

1. Was easy to remember
2. Was six characters or less
3. Was two syllables or less
4. Could be typed with the right hand only
5. Did not contain special characters like "-" or digits like "9", "0", etc.
6. Ended with the extension ".com" instead of ".net" or ".org", etc.
7. Wasn't a name already reserved and being sold for thousands of dollars
8. Could be purchased from Google Domains which offers good security, performance and reliability

After finding out that the "pippim.com" was available, more weeks of contemplation 
went by before "pulling the trigger" and buying the name for $17 CAD per year.

Then this Pippim website was created using 
GitHub Pages for free. More details about how the website
was created can be found on in the middle of the
[Home Page](https://pippim.github.io/#github-pages).
