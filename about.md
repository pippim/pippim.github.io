<a id="where-is-pippim?"></a>
## Where is Pippim located?

Figuratively speaking, Pippim is located in "the clouds" on 
[Google Sites ðŸ”—](https://pippim.com) (https://pippim.com) and
[GitHub ðŸ”—](https://github.com/pippim/pippim.github.io)
(https://github.com/pippim/pippim.github.io) where all the 
source code is kept. The website you are viewing now is found
on [GitHub Pages ðŸ”—](https://pippim.github.io) 
(https://pippim.github.io). All three websites are hosted
for free by the providers. Other than the cost of time to 
learn web design, I can't believe how cheap the process has been!

As you may have deduced by the little yellow dot in this image
though, Pippim is physically located in Edmonton, Canada. 
For a better view, right click on the picture, select
"Open in new tab" and then zoom in with your browser.
This morning, after long bouts of cold weather, it is
surprisingly warm.

## When was Pippim created?

That's an easy question; The Domain Name and website was created October 16, 2021.
Initially www.pippim.com was quickly created on Google Sites. Then the
[main Pippim Website](pippim.github.io) (don't click the link because you are
already here!) was created much slower on GitHhub Pages. Many revisions were 
made -- 1,020 commits (revisions) and still counting as of December 5, 2021.

<a id="why-was-pippim-created?"></a>
## Why was Pippim created?

Pippim was created to make it easier to list the free software created on 
the websites [Ask Ubuntu ðŸ”—](https://askubuntu.com) and [GitHub ðŸ”—](https://github.com).
Pippim Posts which are 95% Answers and 5% Questions, have over **{{ site.views_human }}
views** as of {{ site.refreshed | date: "%B %e, %Y" }}. With over 2,000 answers, 
managing them on a Pippim website just makes sense.

It's common practice to create websites to make money. That isn't why Pippim 
was created though.
Of course we all need money and maybe someday Pippim will earn revenue,
open an office in Silicon Valley and hire some employees. But in the
meantime, Pippim is strictly a labour of love (yes that was already 
said earlier). It would not be unfair to classify Pippim as *"Software
Development as a Hobby"*.

<a id="how-was-pippim-created?"></a>
## How was Pippim created?

Yes this is the 6th section which contradicts the "5 W's". Additionally,
"How" doesn't begin with a "W" which also seems to contradict the "5 W's" but,
as the saying goes:

> Who, What, Where, When, Why *and sometimes How*

So how as Pippin created? Well the
first step was to find a domain name (website name) that:

1. Was easy to remember
2. Was six characters or less
3. Was two syllables or less
4. Could be typed with the right hand only
5. Did not contain special characters like "-" or digits like "9", "0", etc.
6. Ended with the extension ".com" instead of ".net" or ".org", etc.
7. Wasn't a name already reserved and being sold for thousands of dollars
8. Could be purchased from Google Domains which offers good security, performance and reliability

After finding out that the "pippim.com" was available, more weeks of contemplation 
went by before "pulling the trigger" and buying the name for $17 CAD per year.

Then the [www.pippim.com website ðŸ”—](https://pippim.com) was
created using Google Sites for free.

Next the [pippim.github.io website](https://pippim.github.io) (Don't bother
clicking the link as you are here now!) was created using 
GitHub Pages for free. More details about how the website
was created can be found on in the middle of the
[Home Page](https://pippim.github.io/#how-the-table-of-contents-is-generated).

### Hopefully you enjoy the freedom! :)
