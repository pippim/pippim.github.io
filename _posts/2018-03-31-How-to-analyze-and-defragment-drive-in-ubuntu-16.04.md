## Ubuntu doesn't need disk-defragmenting

From this [article][1]:

> If you’re a Linux user, you’ve probably heard that you don’t need to  
> defragment your Linux file systems. You’ll also notice that Linux  
> distributions don’t come with disk-defragmenting utilities. But why is  
> that?  
>   
> To understand why Linux file systems don’t need defragmenting in  
> normal use – and Windows ones do – you’ll need to understand why  
> fragmentation occurs and how Linux and Windows file systems work  
> differently from each other.
