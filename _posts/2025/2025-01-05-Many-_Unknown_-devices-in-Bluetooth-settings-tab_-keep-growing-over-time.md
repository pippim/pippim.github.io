I started a test that has been running for 4 hours doing a Bluetooth device search. 700 unknown devices so far.

I would have stopped the search a couple hours ago, but I'm curious just how many Bluetooth devices are in range.

The reason for the search was accidental. I have LED light strip which uses Bluetooth Low Energy (like smart watches do). Android phone can control the lights but I was told Linux would not. So I was just searching to see if the MAC address would show up. Which it has not.

To answer your question, the devices are your neighbors. You cannot block them from search results as far as I know. Note that nearby devices (i.e. your own devices) are what you are really interested in and they should show up relatively instantly.
