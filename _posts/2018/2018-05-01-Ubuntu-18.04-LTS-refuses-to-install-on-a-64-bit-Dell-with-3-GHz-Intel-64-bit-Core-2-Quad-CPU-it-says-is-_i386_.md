Your **Intel Q9650 64-bit Core 2 Quad CPU** is [not supported by **Windows 10** either](https://communities.intel.com/thread/102696). It was released in 2008 and considered too old for modern operating systems.

Looking at your specs on [Intel's Website](https://ark.intel.com/products/35428/Intel-Core2-Quad-Processor-Q9650-12M-Cache-3_00-GHz-1333-MHz-FSB) I noticed it doesn't have hyper-threading. Also it doesn't have Turbo-Boost which is probably less of a concern.

More importantly there is the 64-bit instruction set which has evolved over time. Linux tests each CPU during boot to see if certain instructions are supported. I can't find the reference I was looking for but this [one](https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Booting/linux-bootstrap-4.html) outlines the kernel checks:


----------


After we have set up the stack, next step is CPU verification. As we are going to execute transition to the long mode, we need to check that the CPU supports long mode and SSE. We will do it by the call of the `verify_cpu` function:

``` 
call    verify_cpu
testl   %eax, %eax
jnz     no_longmode
```

This function defined in the `arch/x86/kernel/verify_cpu.S` assembly file and just contains a couple of calls to the cpuid instruction. This instruction is used for getting information about the processor. In our case, it checks **long mode** and **SSE** support and returns `0` on success or `1` on fail in the `eax` register.

If the value of the `eax` is not zero, we jump to the `no_longmode` label which just stops the CPU by the call of the `hlt` instruction while no hardware interrupt will not happen:

``` 
no_longmode:
1:
    hlt
    jmp     1b
```

If the value of the `eax` register is zero, everything is ok and we are able to continue.


----------

To summarize there are many things your **decade-old** CPU doesn't support that modern 64-bit processors support.
