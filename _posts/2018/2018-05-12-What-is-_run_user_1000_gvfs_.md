# All roads lead to Gnome

Ubuntu is based upon many things plus home-grown programming from Canonical (the owners of Ubuntu). Most people know it is based on Linux kernel and provides a "GNOME" Desktop environment. But it is also based on Debian and perhaps just as important Gnome Internals. It is so intrinsic I dare to say on Ubuntu that: "All roads lead to Gnome".

### What is GIO / gvfs?

In your question, `/run/user/1000/gvfs/` the `gvfs` component stands for "Gnome Virtual File System". Your camera and Android phones are mounted in this "User Space" outside of "Kernel Space" where a normal "mount" occurs.

To learn more about GIO (Gnome Input Output I surmise) see [here][1] and [here][2]. Ubuntu has a page about using GIO to mount devices using the [gvfs-mount command][3].

The other component in your question `/run/user/1000/gvfs/` is the `/run/user` component. This was created by `systemd` to circumvent using the `/tmp` directory which was common practice for such devices because it side-stepped network "rules". See [here][4].

### The other part of your question is how is it different from `/media`?

The `/media` directory is where removable storage is located. The removable storage is in a familiar file format such as `ext4`, `fat` or `ntfs`. The device names and mount names are static.

Your Android phone is not just removable storage, but a removable foreign operating system that has storage. The storage is generally accessed with MTP. However, there is a host of programs to communicate with the phone. That is why it goes into `/run/user/1000/gvfs`. Samba also goes into the same directory chain, but I haven't researched that one yet. 

In the `/run/user/1000` directory structure the mount names are dynamic and change with every connection. For example, my phone currently is:

``` 
$ ll /run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp:host=%5Busb%3A001%2C013%5D
total 0
dr-x------ 1 rick rick 0 Dec 31  1969 ./
dr-x------ 3 rick rick 0 May  9 18:20 ../
drwx------ 1 rick rick 0 Dec 31  1969 Internal storage/
drwx------ 1 rick rick 0 Dec 31  1969 SD card/
```

The USB enumeration is notorious for changing, so you can be assured the directory name will be different next time. `/media` "stuff" on the other hand is static.

Notice the dates shown by Ubuntu 16.04 under Kernel 4.14.34. I haven't had this Android Smartphone since the year 1969. I guess we can call this a bug.
