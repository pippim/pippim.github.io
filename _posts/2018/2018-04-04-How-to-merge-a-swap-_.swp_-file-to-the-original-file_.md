## Direct answer

To technically answer your question:

``` 
cat test.out > experiment.out
cat .test.out.swp >> experiment.out
```

The first redirection of the `cat` command `>` creates a new file. The second redirection of the `cat` command `>>` appends to the existing file.

In reality `experiment.out` probably won't be usable because you are adding an apple to an orange.

## Alternative Repair

You can google repairing the files: [Superuser.com How can I recover the original file from a .swpfile?][1] In short use:

``` 
vim -r .swp
```

**Make copies of all files first!**

If that doesn't work I'd use `gedit` on both files in separate tabs and then in a third tab paste text copied from the first two tabs.
