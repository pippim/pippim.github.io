You can compare cities using:

``` 
diff -Naur <(curl -s http://wttr.in/london ) <(curl -s http://wttr.in/new-york )
```

as illustrated in the top-voted answer. `wttr.in` also makes a great "splash" screen every time you open the terminal. Do this by adding it to your `~/.bashrc` file. I've done that to include Weather, Date, Time and Distribution information as detailed in this answer: [Terminal splash screen with Weather, Calendar, Time & Sysinfo?]({% post_url /2018/2018-03-30-Terminal-splash-screen-with-Weather_-Calendar_-Time-_-Sysinfo_ %})

Sorry I was in Ubuntu in Windows 10 WSL for Spring 2018 updates when I captured this image. Promise I'll boot back into Ubuntu in Linux soon.
