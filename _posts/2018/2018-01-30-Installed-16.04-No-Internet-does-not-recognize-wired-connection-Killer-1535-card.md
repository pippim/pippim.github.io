I'm also on 16.04 and gave the same care on an AW17R3:

``` 
$ lspci -nnk | grep 0280 -A3
3c:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Qualcomm Atheros QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter [168c:003e] (rev 32)
	Subsystem: Bigfoot Networks, Inc. QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter [1a56:1535]
	Kernel driver in use: ath10k_pci
	Kernel modules: ath10k_pci
```

Over the last couple of days a new driver was pushed into 16.04 and 17.10 so hopefully soon if you get a brand new install Live USB it will work fine. From the [bug report][1]:

However this fix is in ***proposed*** section: [https://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/core/xenial/main/proposed/linux-firmware](https://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/core/xenial/main/proposed/linux-firmware)

I'm not sure how long until it gets into the daily build.

FTR I have a separate Killer Wired card which I use day to day so never relied on the WiFi Card above. My wired card:

``` 
3b:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Qualcomm Atheros Killer E2400 Gigabit Ethernet Controller [1969:e0a1] (rev 10)
	Subsystem: Device [0707:2400]
	Kernel driver in use: alx
	Kernel modules: alx
```

I think you should take an Cat 5e cable (blue Ethernet with RJ-45 ends)  and plug it in between your laptop and the router. Hopefully you have a separate Ethernet card and it's not a combined Wired/Wireless/Bluetooth card like you were led to believe.
