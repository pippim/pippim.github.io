As per this answer: [Can I use cron to chime at top of hour like a grandfather clock?]({% post_url /2016/2016-10-02-Can-I-use-cron-to-chime-at-top-of-hour-like-a-grandfather-clock? %})6 you need to export an environment variable before playing sounds in your cron script:

``` 
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="/run/user/1000"

```
