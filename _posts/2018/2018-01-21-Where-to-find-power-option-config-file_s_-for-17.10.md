According to this super user [answer][1]:

You can set the desired settings in GSettings directly.

Timeout for blanking the screen (seconds; 0 = never):

``` 
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 1800
```

Timeout for locking the screen after blanking (seconds; 0 = instant):

``` 
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-delay 0
```
