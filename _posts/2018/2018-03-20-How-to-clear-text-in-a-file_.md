# Not the shortest answer but...

This answer is based on another from [Super User][1]. Although not the shortest bash command, `truncate` is the most readable for average newbies:

``` 
$ echo Hello > Hello.txt
$ echo World! >> Hello.txt
$ cat Hello.txt
Hello
World!
$ truncate -s 0 Hello.txt
$ ll Hello.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rick rick 0 Mar 20 17:32 Hello.txt
```

Parameters used with `truncate` command here:

- "-s" set the size
- "0" size will be zero

# Clear everything except first 10,000 bytes

An advantage of `truncate` is you can specify how much to keep, not just zero:

``` 
$ truncate -s 10000 Hello.txt
```

... will truncate everything after the first 10,000 bytes. This could be useful if a program went crazy and dumped many Megabytes of data into a small log file:

- Run the `truncate` command for a reasonable larger normal size of 10K
- Open the file with your text editor and press <kbd>End</kbd>
- Highlight and <kbd>PgUp</kbd> to delete the remaining bytes that don't belong (usually recognizable by ASCII garbage characters).
