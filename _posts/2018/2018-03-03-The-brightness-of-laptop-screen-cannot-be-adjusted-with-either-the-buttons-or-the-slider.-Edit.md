# NVIDIA doesn't work with Wayland

As others have discovered, nVidia doesn't play well with Wayland: [Ubuntu 17.10 on Wayland - (How) can I install the NVIDIA drivers?][1]. The solution is to switch to Xorg. To summarize the answer from **cl-net** use these steps:

- To install the NVIDIA drivers, execute `sudo apt install nvidia-384`.  

- Additionally you can force the GDM login screen to use Xorg by default.  
To achieve this, just execute `sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf`.  
Remove the character `#` from the line `# WaylandEnable=false`.  
Now press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, then <kbd>Y</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save that change.  

- Restart the Ubuntu operating system, execute `sudo reboot`.

Another problem you will likely encounter is no sound over HDMI to external monitor. To solve this problem see this Q&A: [No Audio Over HDMI on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti][2]
