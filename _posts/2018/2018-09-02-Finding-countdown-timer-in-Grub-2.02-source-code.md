Thanks to the help of the accepted answer I was able to achieve the goal using a different method. After successful Grub 2.02 source code change and recompile, `/etc/default/grub` was changed to a 3.5 second countdown with `GRUB_TIMEOUT=35`.

Notice how the circular progress is now smooth with no "chunks":

The code to change in:

``` 
/grub-2.02/grub-core/normal/menu.c
```

Line 546:

``` 
/* Check whether a second has elapsed since the last tick.  If so, adjust
   the timer and return 1; otherwise, return 0.  */
static int
has_second_elapsed (grub_uint64_t *saved_time)
{
  grub_uint64_t current_time;

  current_time = grub_get_time_ms ();
  /* July 14, 2018 Use deciseconds - change 1000 to 100 */
  if (current_time - *saved_time >= 100)
    {
      *saved_time = current_time;
      return 1;
    }
  else
    return 0;
}
```

Change the line:

``` 
if (current_time - *saved_time >= 1000)
```

to:

``` 
if (current_time - *saved_time >= 100)
```

## **Voila!** one line of code to change. Plus two comment lines added for good measure.


## How to compile `grub 2.02`

Before following instructions on Grub's [website][1]:

``` 
sudo apt install bison
sudo apt install flex
```

Then follow grub's website instructions:

``` 
cd grub-2.02
./configure
```

Run next command on Grub's website:

``` 
make install
```

Files are created in `/usr/local/bin` (surprise!!!) along with `.../grub-2.02` directory which is to be expected.

## Miscellaneous problems compiling grub

I ended up cloning source to VM (Lubuntu 16.04) and recompiling there. Using the newly compiled `grub-install` mucked things up and I had to use `sudo apt install grub2` to get fresh install. Then manually copying newly compiled files to `/boot/grub/i386-pc`

My terminal-box got all skewed up so I'll have to create a new grub background image. In the image below I changed `GRUB_TIMEOUT=35` for 3.5 second countdown.

## July 16, 2018 update

Figured out to one parameter to use in order to get X86, EFI support:

``` 
./configure –with-platform=efi

*******************************************************
GRUB2 will be compiled with following components:
Platform: x86_64-efi
With devmapper support: No (need libdevmapper header)
With memory debugging: No
With disk cache statistics: No
With boot time statistics: No
efiemu runtime: No (not available on efi)
grub-mkfont: No (need freetype2 library)
grub-mount: No (need FUSE library)
starfield theme: No (No build-time grub-mkfont)
With libzfs support: No (need zfs library)
Build-time grub-mkfont: No (need freetype2 library)
Without unifont (no build-time grub-mkfont)
Without liblzma (no support for XZ-compressed mips images) (need lzma library)
*******************************************************
```

However, after `make install` there is an error:

``` 
Making install in grub-core

```

I filed a bug report with Grub folks (July 2018) but haven't heard a thing back. The next step for EFI system is to download the source code on fresh install using Ubuntu's repositories instead of Grub's website instructions.
