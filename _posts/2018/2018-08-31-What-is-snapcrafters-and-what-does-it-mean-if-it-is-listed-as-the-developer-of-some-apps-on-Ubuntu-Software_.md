Snapcrafters is a `github` area where developers can package their **snap** applications. You can find [**GIMP**][1] there too. Apparently developers find publishing their apps as snap applications is easier than publishing them as `.deb` files installed with `sudo apt install ...`. Furthermore putting their snaps in Snapcrafters is even easier.
