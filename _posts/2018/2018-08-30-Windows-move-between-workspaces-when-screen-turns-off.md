There is a four year old bug report on this and the fix is in and it's been triaged:

[Windows change Monitor/Desktop after screen lock][1]

In the short term instead of locking the screen on inactivity (which basically shuts it off with gnome-screensaver I think) you could consider a screen saver with password that kicks in after a period of inactivity. I haven't tested this myself mind you.
