Overheating is a common problem in Linux. This article: [Most Effective Ways To Reduce Laptop Overheating In Linux][1] suggests five applications:

- Install TLP (and optional Thinkpad support in your case)
- Install Thermald
- Install Laptop Mode Tools (often not necessary)
- Install CPUFreq (often not necessary)
- Monitor System temperatures

You do **NOT** need to add PPAs as the article instructs to install `TLP`. See this answer: [How can I install TLP in Ubuntu 18.04?]({% post_url /2018/2018-11-11-How-can-I-install-TLP-in-Ubuntu-18.04_ %})

You can read an in-depth Q&A here in **Ask Ubuntu** on CPU temperature control: [Stop cpu from overheating]({% post_url /2017/2017-01-25-Stop-cpu-from-overheating %})
