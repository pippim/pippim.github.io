In addition to `nouveau-modeset=0`, you can use `nvidia.modeset=0` for a pure Intel HD 530 graphics environment which is many times easier to use than nVidia.

Many users find less screen-tearing and crisper fonts with Intel. Additionally there is less power drain and heat.

After installation and successful booting into Ubuntu you can type into the terminal:

``` 
sudo prime-select intel # turn on intel graphics
```

or:

``` 
sudo prime-select nvidia # turn on nvidia graphics
```

Then reboot to implement the configuration change.

Note you don't type `#` and the comment that follows.

HTH.
