## Background

It has been proposed this Firefox Bug 1492360: [High CPU usage when open Firefox before chrome/chromium][1]. That is a duplicate of Bug 1495900: [Starting Chrome makes Firefox content processes hang for about two minutes, due to FontConfig font rescanning (FcInitReinitialize)][2], is the culprit.

### But I'm on Firefox too:

### And when I open up Chrome:

[![Chrome version.png][4]][4]

### I don't see any performance hit to CPUs.

It may be against your morals but perhaps you can try installing `google-chrome-stable` like I have. Then do the test again. If there is no CPU usage spike to 100% then a bug report could be filed between Chromium and Chrome.

I'm on Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS. Although kernel is currently `4.14.78` LTS chain I don't think that has anything to do with it as I didn't notice CPU hits on previous kernels either.

The only time I see all CPU's at 100% is during `update-initramfs`.

## `fontconfig` version

In the bug report it is revealed:

``` 
$ dpkg -l 'fontconfig*' | grep "^ii"
ii  fontconfig        2.12.6-0ubuntu2 amd64        generic font configuration library - support binaries
ii  fontconfig-config 2.12.6-0ubuntu2 all          generic font configuration library - configuration
```

In my non-buggy version (could be because of no local fonts though):

``` 
$ dpkg -l 'fontconfig*' | grep "^ii"
ii  fontconfig        2.11.94-0ubuntu1.1 amd64        generic font configuration library - support binaries
ii  fontconfig-config 2.11.94-0ubuntu1.1 all          generic font configuration library - configuration
```

I'm at `2.11.94` version earlier than bug report `2.12` version. In bug report upgrading to `2.13` is a recommended solution but OP mentioned in comments this isn't possible. As such `2.11.94` **might** be an option.
