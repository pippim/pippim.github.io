# Bug in Meltdown/Spectre Intel Microcode

There was a [bug in early 2018 Intel Microcode update][1] to address Meltdown/Spectre security holes. As such the microcode had to be rolled back to a previous version.

Here is the microcode I'm using (having opted out of all updates starting January 2018):

``` 
$ apt list --installed | grep intel-microcode

WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with caution in scripts.

intel-microcode/now 3.20170707.1~ubuntu16.04.0 amd64 [installed,upgradable to: 3.20180108.0+really20170707ubuntu16.04.1]
```

When you install Intel Microcode Update you will get this version or something similar:

``` 
intel-microcode/3.20180108.0+really20170707ubuntu16.04.1
```

# Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Menu

I'm not sure about Lubuntu menu structure but for regular Ubuntu this is how you access the Intel Microcode Update controls:

The bottom option controls Intel Microcode Updates.

# Install Intel Microcode from CLI

To skip the GUI menus altogether you can install from command line:

``` 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install intel-microcode
```

# `dmesg` now shows correct output

After following the installation steps `dmesg` returns the desired output (unlike in your question where it shows nothing):

``` 
$ dmesg | grep -i microcode
[    1.166542] microcode: sig=0x506e3, pf=0x20, revision=0xba
[    1.166993] microcode: Microcode Update Driver: v2.2.
[16082.584598] microcode: microcode updated early to revision 0xba, date = 2017-04-09
```
