No harm will come.

The second time you try to install a package it will simply tell you it's already installed.

If the package was just installed it will say:

``` 
<Package> is already the newest version (<version number>)
```

If the package was upgraded since it was last installed/upgraded then it will be upgraded:

``` 
The following packages will be upgraded:
  <Package>
1 upgraded, 0 newly installed, ___ to remove and ___ not upgraded
```
