As much as I like Oli (which is a lot!) I disagree with him on the `find` command. I don't like it.

## `find` command takes over three minutes

Take for example this simple command:

``` 
$ time find / -type f -name "mail-transport-agent.target"
find: ‘/lost+found’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/ssmtp’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/ssl/private’: Permission denied
    (... SNIP ...)
find: ‘/run/user/997’: Permission denied
find: ‘/run/sudo’: Permission denied
find: ‘/run/systemd/inaccessible’: Permission denied

real	3m40.589s
user	0m4.156s
sys	    0m8.874s
```

It takes over **three minutes** for `find` to search everything starting from `/`. By default reams of error messages appear and you must search through them to find what you are looking for. Still it is better than `grep` to search the whole drive for a string which takes **53 hours**: [`grep`ing all files for a string takes a long time][1]

I know I can fiddle with the find command's parameters to make it work better but the point here is the amount of time it takes to run.

## `locate` command takes less than a second

Now let's use `locate`:

``` 
$ time locate mail-transport-agent.target
/lib/systemd/system/mail-transport-agent.target

real	0m0.816s
user	0m0.792s
sys	    0m0.024s
```

The **locate** command takes less than a second!

## `updatedb` only run once a day by default

It is true the `updatedb` command which updates the **locate database** is only run once a day by default. You can run it manually before searching for files just added by using:

``` 
$ time sudo updatedb

real	0m3.460s
user	0m0.503s
sys	    0m1.167s
```

Although this will take 3 seconds, it's small in comparison to `find` command's 3+ minutes.

I've updated my `sudo crontab -e` to include the line at the bottom:

``` 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
  0 0  1   *   *     /bin/journalctl --vacuum-size=200M
*/5 *  *   *   *     /usr/bin/updatedb
```

Now every five minutes `updatedb` is run and `locate` commands database is almost always up-to-date.

## But there are no attributes?

You can pipe `locate` output to other commands. If for example you want the file attributes you can use:

``` 
$ locate mail-transport-agent.target | xargs stat
  File: '/lib/systemd/system/mail-transport-agent.target'
  Size: 473       	Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file

## Summary

I posted this answer to show the speed and ease of use of `locate`. I tried to address some of the command short-comings pointed out by others.

The `find` command needs to traverse the entire directory structure to find files. The `locate` command has it's own database which gives it lightning speed in comparison.
