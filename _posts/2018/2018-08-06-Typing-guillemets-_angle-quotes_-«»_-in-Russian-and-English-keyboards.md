Apparently having an <kbd>AltGr</kbd> (Alternate Graphics) key on your keyboard where the <kbd>Right Alt</kbd> resides on US style keyboards is helpful for <kbd>«</kbd> and <kbd>»</kbd> simulation key strokes.

From this [French article][1], translated by google below, it says:

- Under X11 (GNU / Linux) :

  -  AltGr w (oss variant) or AltGr z (fr variant) and AltGr x give the left and right quotation marks "and"

Further discussion can be found in [Wikipedia][2]:

> AltGr (also Alt Graph, or Right Alt[1]) is a modifier key found on  
> some computer keyboards and is primarily used to type characters that  
> are unusual for the locale of the keyboard layout, such as currency  
> symbols and accented letters. On a typical, IBM-compatible PC  
> keyboard, the AltGr key, when present, takes the place of the  
> right-hand Alt key. In macOS, the Option key has functions similar to  
> the AltGr key.  

There is a lot more to read in the link!
