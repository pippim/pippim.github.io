## New version using `pavucontrol`

First install the app:

``` 
sudo apt install pavucontrol
```

Then call it from the launcher by typing the first few letters `pav` and selecting the icon. Follow the `.gif` below to click on the individual speakers and set their volume:

## Original version not working

Your question *"What kind of malformed wizardry is this?"* can best be answered with this command:

``` 
$ grep channels /etc/pulse/daemon.conf
; default-sample-channels = 2
```

Using `sudo` powers edit the file `/etc/pulse/daemon.conf` and change the line:

``` 
; default-sample-channels = 2
```

to:

``` 
; default-sample-channels = 6
```

Save the file and exit your editor. To restart pulse audio use:

``` 
pulseaudio -k
```
