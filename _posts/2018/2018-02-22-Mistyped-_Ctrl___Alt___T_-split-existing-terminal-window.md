For years now I've been using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> to open a new terminal window. Just now for the first time it took my existing window and created two panes within it:

^^ *New terminal session with `~/.bashrc` start up commands showing date, time and system information. ie No commands run yet*

I must have hit a different key combination as I just tried it again double checking as I pressed <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> and a new window as normal.

As I might want to utilize this feature in the future, What key combination did I use?
