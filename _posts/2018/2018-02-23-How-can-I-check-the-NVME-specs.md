# lsblk (List Block)

You can use `lsblk` command:

``` 
$ lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,LABEL,MOUNTPOINT,SIZE,MODEL
NAME        FSTYPE LABEL                 MOUNTPOINT     SIZE MODEL
sdb                                                   186.3G 2105

```

You can see my NVMe SSD is a **Samsung SSD 960 PRO 512GB**

# Create an `alias` for arguments

As pointed out in comments a typo was made for `MODEL` and the output was incomplete. To avoid that in the future and more importantly so you don't have to remember the arguments create an `alias` in `~/.bashrc` called `lsdrv` which you can use all the time:

``` 
$ cat ~/.bashrc | grep lsdrv
# Create lsdrv version of lsblk without UUID's
alias lsdrv="lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,LABEL,MOUNTPOINT,SIZE,MODEL"
```

Now in the terminal you can simply use `lsdrv` to see all your drives complete with model number and other useful information.

# Voltage / Power

This is pretty much irrelevant. The deciding factor is M.2 22x80 mm size or a different size. Also whether if it is Gen 3 x 2 or Gen 3 x 4 speed (the second is twice as fast). 

For example I have two M.2 SSD bays the first one supports Gen 3 x 4 speeds the second one only supports Gen 3 x 2 speeds because there are a limited number of PCIe lanes on the Skylake chipset.

There may be other issues but this is what I remember off the top of my head. You should of course do your own research.

Basically you need to know the make and model of your computer to know the make and models of the M.2 NVMe SSDs you can install in it.
