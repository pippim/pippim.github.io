I'll answering your last question first. The newer live-usb ISO's are hybrids that work for both MBR and GPT systems. `gparted` cannot read these after Startup Disk Creator has burned the ISO to the USB flash drive. Rather than taking your USB to another computer to reformat it you can use `dd` (Data Destroyer, real name Data Duplicator):

``` 
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=1
```

Change `sdX` to `sdd`, `sde`, or whatever your USB drive letter is. 

### *Use `dd` with great caution!*

As you discovered Ubuntu 16.04 Startup Disk Creator no longer provides an option for persistence storage for a Live Boot USB Flash Drive. But `mkusb` does provide this feature and it works well even for creating a pre-release Ubuntu 18.04 Live Boot USB.

For more about `mkusb` details read about it [here][1].
