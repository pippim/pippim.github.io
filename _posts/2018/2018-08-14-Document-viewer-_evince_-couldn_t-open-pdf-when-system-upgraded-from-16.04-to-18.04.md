## Library path incorrect

Nine years ago on this [bug report][1] it was discovered:

> installed a version without using the packaging system and it's taking  
> over the ubuntu build and breaking your installation  
>   
> " libpoppler-glib.so.4 => /usr/local/lib/libpoppler-glib.so.4  
> (0xb78b0000)"  
>   
> clean that and it should be working correctly  

The solution was to remove:

``` 
sudo rm -f /usr/local/lib/libpoppler-glib.so.4
```


----------

Nine years later and you have a similar problem.  Checking `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is pointing to a single dir rather than the full path list. There is an incorrect version of `libpoppler-cpp.so` and `libpoppler-glib.so.8` there.

Moving `libpopper*` to another directory allowed `evince` to work with the proper dynamic linker searches in `/lib` and `/usr/lib`.
