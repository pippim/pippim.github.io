The guy obviously spent a lot of time with his self-answered questions. I must admit they were "TL;DR" (Too long, didn't read) for me. They might serve some purpose for others down the road.

My inclination would be to post a comment they are too abstract / obscure and then VTC as too-broad or off-topic. I would try to suggest an alternate site for him to post on. Perhaps even suggest he start a blog.

My rationale for posting a comment would be guilt for the VTC over the amount of effort placed into the self-answered Q&A.
