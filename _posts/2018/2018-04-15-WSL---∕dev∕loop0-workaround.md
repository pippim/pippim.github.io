There is no `/dev/` support in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). There is a [Microsoft User Voice Page][1] where you can comment your needs for such support. Currently 779 people have voted for this feature. You can post a comment linking back to this question and pointing out how the feature is needed to install your software.

For myself it would be great to have `/sys/class/backlight` support. It seems every WSL user has something they'd like supported in future versions.
