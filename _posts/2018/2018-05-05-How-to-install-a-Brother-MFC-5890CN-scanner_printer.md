Ubuntu **12.04** is no longer supported but here is an answer for **16.04**: [How to get a Brother DCP-350C scanner working?][1].

To summarize the answer, first go to the [Brother Printer/Scanner website][2]. Then select your printer model:

Select the right product (Printer/Scanner). In the printer icon for `MFC-J410W`, click the link **Not your product?** and a selection page appears:

The screen below is for the MFC350 printer/scanner which has a sub-menu for "DCP 3 Series" which leads to a specific model:

My printer is the fourth icon in the panel, which being 3 icons wide is immediately below yours. I'll select that and it has a sub-menu for "DCP 7 Series" which after clicking presents:

I'll click on **DCP-7065DN**. You would have already selected **DCP-350C** on the previous screenshot.

After selecting the printer model, you are asked for your OS. It defaults to Linux and ".rpm". The default is ".rpm" which stands for **Red Hat** or **Arch Linux** or something like that. Change the distro to ".deb" which stands for **Debian** which is really **Ubuntu**.
