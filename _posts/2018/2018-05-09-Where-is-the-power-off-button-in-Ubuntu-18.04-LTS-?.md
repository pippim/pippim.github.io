## Sign In with Unity

To get the familiar interface to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS you need to sign in using the **Unity** interface. Do this right on the Sign In screen:

click the "gear" to select the Unity Desktop Environment (DE).

## Familiar look and feel

Now you will see the familiar "gear" on the top right of your screen where you can select "Lock Screen", "Log Out", "Suspend" and "Shutdown". If you press the power button you'll get your regular selector:

This video also shows how to activate the lock screen option which is disabled for some users.

Also of interest is some users are not getting a chance to select an action because system shuts down immediately: [https://askubuntu.com/questions/1032461/how-to-make-ubuntu-18-04-lts-ask-for-action-when-i-press-acpi-power-button-key-o/1032948#1032948](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1032461/how-to-make-ubuntu-18-04-lts-ask-for-action-when-i-press-acpi-power-button-key-o/1032948#1032948)
