# Update is breaking your system

After installing DO NOT update your software.

## Find out your kernel version with `uname -r`:

``` 
$ uname -r
4.14.15-041415-generic
```

## Find out the specific package names

Replace `4.14.15-041415-generic` below with what your `uname -r` returned above:

``` 
$ apt list --installed | grep 4.14.15-041415-generic

WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with caution in scripts.

linux-headers-4.14.15-041415-generic/now 4.14.15-041415.201801231530 amd64 [installed,local]
linux-image-4.14.15-041415-generic/now 4.14.15-041415.201801231530 amd64 [installed,local]
```

## Pin the packages so they don't get updated

Replace `4.14.15-041415-generic` below with what your `uname -r` returned above:

``` 
$ sudo apt-mark hold linux-headers-4.14.15-041415-generic
linux-headers-4.14.15-041415-generic set on hold.
$ sudo apt-mark hold linux-image-4.14.15-041415-generic
linux-image-4.14.15-041415-generic set on hold.
```

## Now it's safe to update your software

You can update your software through the software centre or using:
