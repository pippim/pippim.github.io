# Simple Solution

When signal is lost to HDMI (during sleep) Pulse Audio is automatically configured to active source (your laptop's speakers). Upon resume the sound device is still your laptop. To override this setting, tell Pulse Audio to never switch sound devices automatically:

- edit the file `/etc/pulse/default.pa`
- find the line `load-module module-switch-on-port-available`
- insert a `#` at the beginning of the line to disable automatic port switching
- save the file and reboot.

# Complex Solution

Before I learned of the simple solution, I used a more complex solution based on `systemd` suspend/resume hook:

- [Ubuntu changing default audio output after suspend]({% post_url /2016/2016-10-22-Ubuntu-changing-default-audio-output-after-suspend %})

An even more complex solution for when HDMI TV is unplugged and replugged is based on `udev` rule:

- [Switch between internal and HDMI speakers automatically]({% post_url /2016/2016-11-27-Switch-between-internal-and-HDMI-speakers-automatically %})
