I use a script called `sgedit` which inherits user preferences for font, tabs, and extensions. It uses `sudo -H gedit` instead of `gksu gedit` for stability in GUI environment. It prompts for a password.

## Have `sudo` inherit your user account `gedit` settings

In this example the user settings for font name, font size, tab stops, convert tabs to spaces, 80 column highlight, and right side thumbnail slider bar have been inherited by `sudo`.

With regular `sudo -H gedit` you cannot make nor save these configuration settings. With the script below `sgedit` the settings are inherited from your user account.

This script also addresses the "`gksu` is bad and not installed by default" and "`pkexec` is hard to setup" problems.

----------

## Background

I've been nagged by the same issue for years. This weekend's project was to write the `sgedit` script:

- Call using `sgedit filename1 filename2...`
- Gets user's gedit settings for tab stops, fonts, line-wrap, etc.
- Elevates to `sudo -H` to preserve file ownership whilst getting root powers. 
- Requests password if last sudo has timed out.
- Gets sudo's gedit settings
- Compares differences between user and sudo gedit settings
- Runs `gsettings set` on the differences only (reduces 174 `set` commands to a dozen or less. Next time it's run perhaps only one or two changes but often times none.
- Calls gedit as a background task such that terminal prompt reappears immediately.

# Bash script `sgedit`



``` bash
#!/bin/bash

# NAME: sgedit
# PATH: /mnt/e/bin
# DESC: Run gedit as sudo using $USER preferences
# DATE: June 17, 2018.

# Must not prefix with sudo when calling script
if [[ $(id -u) == 0 ]]; then
    zenity --error --text "You cannot call this script using sudo. Aborting."
    exit 99
fi

# Get user preferences before elevating to sudo
gsettings list-recursively | grep -i gedit | grep -v history |
    grep -v docinfo |
    grep -v virtual-root | grep -v state.window > /tmp/gedit.gsettings

sudoFunc () {
    # Must be running as sudo
    if [[ $(id -u) != 0 ]]; then
        zenity --error --text "Sudo password authentication failed. Aborting."
        exit 99
    fi

    # Get sudo's gedit preferences
    gsettings list-recursively | grep -i gedit | grep -v history |
        grep -v docinfo |
        grep -v virtual-root | grep -v state.window > /tmp/gedit.gsettings.root
    diff /tmp/gedit.gsettings.root /tmp/gedit.gsettings | grep '>' > /tmp/gedit.gsettings.diff
    sed -i 's/>/gsettings set/g; s/uint32 //g' /tmp/gedit.gsettings.diff
    chmod +x /tmp/gedit.gsettings.diff
    bash -x /tmp/gedit.gsettings.diff  # Display override setting to terminal
    nohup gedit $@ &>/dev/null &
}

FUNC=$(declare -f sudoFunc)
sudo -H bash -c "$FUNC; sudoFunc $*;"
```

## Housekeeping

Copy the bash script above to a new file called `sgedit`. I recommend placing it in your `$HOME/bin` directory, i.e. `/home/YOURNAME/bin`. You may have to create the directory first.

Mark the file as executable using:

``` bash
chmod a+x ~/sgedit
```

Note `~` is a shortcut for `/home/YOURNAME`.
