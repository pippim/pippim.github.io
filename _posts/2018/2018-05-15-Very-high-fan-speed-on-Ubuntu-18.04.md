I struggled with fan speed and thermal issues for a long time before I found `tlp` which has solved all my problems. You can learn more [here][1]:

Installation is the predictable

``` 
sudo apt install tlp
```

Configuration is automatic and I've never had to change it out of the box. 


----------

If `tlp` by itself doesn't solve all your thermal issues there are specific steps you can take for [ASUS Laptops][2]:

### Kernel modules overview

-     `asus-nb-wmi` is a kernel module, which is included in mainstream Linux kernel and is loaded automatically in Asus laptops. It will only allow to control a single fan and if there is a second fan - you will not have any controls over it. Blacklisting this module will prevent keyboard backlight to work.
-    `asus_fan` is a kernel module, which allows to control both fans on some older Asus laptops. Does not work with the most recent models.

For myself after installing `tlp` I was able to remove a couple of fan control programs I had struggled to setup for my laptop. However I do not have an ASUS so you might need something more than just `tlp`.
