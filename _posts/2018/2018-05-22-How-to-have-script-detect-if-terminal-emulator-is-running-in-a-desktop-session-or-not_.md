This is what I've been using:



``` bash
# $TERM variable may be missing when called via desktop shortcut
CurrentTERM=$(env | grep TERM)
if [[ $CurrentTERM == "" ]] ; then
    notify-send --urgency=critical "$0 cannot be run from GUI without TERM environment variable."
    exit 1
fi
```

The reason for this code was this question: [Desktop shortcut to Bash script crashes and burns][1]

You can modify it to look like this:

``` bash
# $TERM variable may be missing when called via desktop shortcut
CurrentTERM=$(env | grep TERM)
if [[ $CurrentTERM == "" ]] ; then
    nano ...
else
    gedit ...
fi
```
