To open Nautilus from the current directory use:

``` 
nautilus .
```

To open with a given file selected use:

``` 
nautilus . -s filename
```

If the file name has spaces enclose it in double quotes (`" `).

# Warning messages will appear

Nautilus, gedit and other apps are all based on Gnome Took Kit (GTK) and it is infamous for giving warning messages. 99% of the time you can ignore them. Does `nautilus` open ok with the current directory displayed? That is the only question. For Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS with `xorg` there are lots of warnings:

``` 
$ nautilus .

(nautilus:18233): GLib-GIO-CRITICAL **: g_dbus_interface_skeleton_unexport: assertion 'interface_->priv->connections != NULL' failed

(nautilus:18233): GLib-GIO-CRITICAL **: g_dbus_interface_skeleton_unexport: assertion 'interface_->priv->connections != NULL' failed

(nautilus:18233): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_icon_theme_get_for_screen: assertion 'GDK_IS_SCREEN (screen)' failed

(nautilus:18233): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: invalid (NULL) pointer instance

(nautilus:18233): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_signal_connect_object: assertion 'G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE (instance)' failed
```


Once again Nautilus works fine and these annoying warning messages are simply part of the Gnome back bone history of Ubuntu and other Linux distributions.
