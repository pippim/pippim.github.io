TLP will power off devices during suspend to save battery life. This answer: [Need to reconnect ethernet cable to get it work after docking laptop into dock station]({% post_url /2017/2017-10-05-Need-to-reconnect-ethernet-cable-to-get-it-work-after-docking-laptop-into-dock-station %}). will reload the R8169 drivers for you realtek network card and might be a sufficient approach.

Another approach is to leave power to the network card during suspend. To do this use `sudo -H gedit /etc/default/tlp` and insert these lines:

``` 
USB_BLACKLIST="10ec:8168"
USB_BLACKLIST="103c:832b"
```

Save the file and reboot.
