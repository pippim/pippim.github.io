# Adjusting brightness with software controls

When you lack hardware controls to adjust brightness the only option is via software.

## Find your monitor name using `xrandr`

Run this command to find monitors connected to `xrandr`:

``` 
$ xrandr | grep connected | grep -v dis
eDP-1 connected primary 1920x1080+0+1080 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 382mm x 215mm
DP-1 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 1107mm x 623mm
```

For me it is `eDP-1` but on your system it is `DP-3`

## Set --brightness in `xrandr`

You can set brightness to screen off `0` to full bright `1`.

You can set it above full bright ie `1.5` but your colors will become overly saturated.

A good starting point for a screen that is too bright (hard on your poor eyes) is `.5`

``` 
xrandr --output DP-3 --brightness .5
```

From there you can adjust accordingly.
