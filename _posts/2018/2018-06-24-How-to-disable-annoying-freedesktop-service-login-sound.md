You need to find out what is generating the system sound. The next time it happens immediately open a terminal and type `journalctl -b`. Then press the <kbd>End</kbd> key and read what program is issuing the sound.

If nothing appears press <kbd>q</kbd> to quit. Then type `dmesg` and look for an offending program there. The timestamps are important for linking the program in question to the time the sound occurred.
