***"If there's a way to enable scrolling up in xterm"*** since you can't scroll up you can send all output to a file by using:

``` 
sudo apt install -f > output.log
```

Then edit `output.log` and copy the messages to your question. Your chances of getting a good answer improve with more information.

As far as anyone else wanting to copy their data to a backup partition before upgrading to 18.04 here is the command borrowed from this answer: [Bash script to clone Ubuntu to new partition for testing 18.04 LTS upgrade][1]

``` 
rsync -haxAX --stats --delete --info=progress2 --info=name0 /* "$TargetMnt" \
      --exclude={/dev/*,/proc/*,/sys/*,/tmp/*,/run/*,/mnt/*,/media/*,/lost+found}
```

Before running the command you need to create a backup partition and mount it. After mounting it set:

``` 
TargetMnt=/mnt/my_backup_partition_name
```

Of course an easier method is just running the script linked above. It not only provides for interactive selection of the backup partition but provides validation and modifies `grub` so you can boot into the backup partition if need be.

PS I'm sad to hear about your problems and the many other problems I've read here in **Ask Ubuntu** since the release of 18.04. Unfortunately you see similar problems with each new release. Hopefully some day Conical stresses the importance of backing up and/or testing on a clone partition first before upgrading. Especially before the first point release of 18.04.1 which comes in July 26, 2018.
