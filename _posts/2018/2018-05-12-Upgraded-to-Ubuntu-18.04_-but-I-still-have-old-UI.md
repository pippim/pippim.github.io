When you were running Ubuntu 16.04 you were on the **Unity** interface. After upgrading to 18.04 the Unity interface is still there but new interfaces are offered as well. It sounds like you are searching for the **Gnome** Desktop which you can select from the "gear" next to the <kbd>Sign In</kbd> button during login:

You can try all the desktops to see which you like best but keep in mind:

- Many have reported problems using the Wayland window manager which was designed to replace X11 but has not lived up to expectations.
- When I tested 18.04 upgrade of 16.04 clone some of the options resulted in a purple screen with only a movable mouse cursor.
