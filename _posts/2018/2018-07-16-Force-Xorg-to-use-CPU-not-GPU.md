This answer: [Use integrated graphics for display and NVIDIA GPU for CUDA on Ubuntu 14.04][1] appears relevant for you.

In summary setting up `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` as follows:

``` 
Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier "layout"
    Screen 0 "intel"
    Screen 1 "nvidia"
EndSection

Section "Device"
    Identifier "intel"
    Driver "intel"
    BusID "PCI:0@0:2:0"
    Option "AccelMethod" "SNA"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "intel"
    Device "intel"
EndSection

Section "Device"
    Identifier "nvidia"
    Driver "nvidia"
    BusID "PCI:1@0:0:0"
    Option "ConstrainCursor" "off"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "nvidia"
    Device "nvidia"
    Option "AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration" "on"
    Option "IgnoreDisplayDevices" "CRT"
EndSection
```

According [Asus Canada specs][2]:

> Integrated Graphics Processor- Intel® HD Graphics support Multi-VGA  
> output support : HDMI/DVI-D/RGB/DisplayPort ports  
> - Supports HDMI with max. resolution 4096 x 2160 @ 24 Hz / 2560 x 1600 @ 60 Hz

> - Supports DisplayPort with max. resolution 4096 x 2304 @ 60 Hz Maximum shared memory of 512 MB Supports Intel® InTru™ 3D, Quick Sync  
> Video, Clear Video HD Technology, Insider™ Supports up to 3 displays  
> simultaneously DP 1.2 Multi-Stream Transport compliant, supports DP  
> 1.2 monitor daisy chain up to 3 displays  

I suggest temporarily taking out your two nVidia cards, plugging a monitor into the on-board HDMI port and booting with a Live USB to runs tests with Ubuntu.

It is important to know your CPU. Discover this using:

``` 
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'model name'
```

and report back.
