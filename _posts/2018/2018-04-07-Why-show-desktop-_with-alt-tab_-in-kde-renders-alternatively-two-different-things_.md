<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> is window selector Ubuntu and Windows but in KDE it shows the desktop. In Ubuntu <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> will minimize all Windows and reveal the desktop (with icons).

The OP's solution is to turn off desktop icons using:

``` 
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false
```

Now there are no icons on the desktop at all, whether you minimize all Windows or not.

[Another option][1] is to install **KDE** add-on; `kwin-addons` in [K]ubuntu 16.04:

``` 
sudo apt-get install kwin-addons
```

The solution (which might be your original problem) could be "Large Icons" as this screen (from the Arch Linux link) shows:
