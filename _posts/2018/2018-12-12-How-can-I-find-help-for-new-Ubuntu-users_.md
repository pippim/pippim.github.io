There is on-line [documentation][1] you can access for **Lubuntu**.

There are links to readable topics (with lots of images and/or animations) for common tasks:

- Browse the web
- Change the date, time and timezone
- Change the wallpaper
- Connect to online accounts
- Use the system search
- Use windows and workspaces
- Get online
- Launch applications
- Switch tasks
