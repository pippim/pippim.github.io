From [this tutorial][1] you need to create a database and user to use mySQL.


## To create a MySQL database and user, follow these steps

At the command line, log in to MySQL as the root user:

``` 
mysql -u root -p
```

Type the MySQL root password, and then press Enter.

To create a database user, type the following command. Replace `username` with the user you want to create, and replace password with the user's password:

``` 
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

This command grants the user all permissions. However, you can grant specific permissions to maintain precise control over database access. For example, to explicitly grant the `SELECT` permission, you would use the following command:

``` 
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
```

For more information about setting MySQL database permissions, please visit [MySQL - 13.7.1.6 GRANT Statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/grant.html).

Type `\q` to exit the mysql program.

To log in to MySQL as the user you just created, type the following command. Replace `username` with the name of the user you created above:

``` 
mysql -u username -p
```

Type the user's password, and then press Enter.

To create a database, type the following command. Replace `dbname` with the name of the database that you want to create:

``` 
CREATE DATABASE dbname;
```

To work with the new database, type the following command. Replace `dbname` with the name of the database you created above:

``` 
USE dbname;
```

You can now work with the database. For example, the following commands demonstrate how to create a basic table named example, and how to insert some data into it:

``` 
CREATE TABLE example ( id smallint unsigned not null auto_increment, name varchar(20) not null, constraint pk_example primary key (id) );
INSERT INTO example ( id, name ) VALUES ( null, 'Sample data' );
```
