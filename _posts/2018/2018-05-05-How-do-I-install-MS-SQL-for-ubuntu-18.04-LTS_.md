[Micrsoft's SQL website][1] was last updated in April 2018 and shows Ubuntu 16.04 as the most currently supported version. I would wait until July 26, 2018 when Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS is released to expect support from Microsoft.

Instead of paying for Microsoft's SQL you could try the [free version of MySQL][2] which supports Ubuntu 18.04 already.
