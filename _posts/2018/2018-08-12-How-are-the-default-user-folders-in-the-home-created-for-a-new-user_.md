The defaults can be examined using:

``` 
$ cat /etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults
# Default settings for user directories
#
# The values are relative pathnames from the home directory and
# will be translated on a per-path-element basis into the users locale
DESKTOP=Desktop
DOWNLOAD=Downloads
TEMPLATES=Templates
PUBLICSHARE=Public
DOCUMENTS=Documents
MUSIC=Music
PICTURES=Pictures
VIDEOS=Videos
# Another alternative is:
#MUSIC=Documents/Music
#PICTURES=Documents/Pictures
#VIDEOS=Documents/Videos
```

If you don't want a specific subdirectory created put a `#` in front of it to comment out the line.

The sub-directories aren't created until the user logs in with a GUI: [Create default home directory for existing user in terminal](Create default home directory for existing user in terminal)
