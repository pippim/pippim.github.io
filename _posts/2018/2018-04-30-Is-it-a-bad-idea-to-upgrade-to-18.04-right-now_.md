If you have enough disk space to hold an extra copy of **Ubuntu 16.04** then I'd say it's worth upgrading to **18.04** on a **cloned test version** today, tomorrow, next week and next month.

Each time you upgrade you will learn a little bit more about new features, new bugs and new fixes to bugs you encountered the last time. By the time you are ready to upgrade for real you'll be confident the process will be error free and have a good understanding of how to use the new applications and OS.

You can boot with a Live USB and manually clone your Ubuntu 16.04 partition or you can run this script: [Bash script to clone Ubuntu to new partition for testing 18.04 LTS upgrade][1].

You can also create a **test plan** for what you need to test after upgrading your cloned 16.04 to 18.04: [Is 18.04 already somewhat safe for installing?][2]
