Go to this [page][1] and search on `4.15.5` and you will see:

``` 
Ubuntu Kernel Version   Ubuntu Kernel Tag     Mainline Kernel Version
4.15.0-11.12            Ubuntu-4.15.0-11.12	  4.15.5

```

I'm not totally convinced this page is complete or updated on a timely basis but it is the closest answer I've found so far.
