## Hardware problem

It turns out this was a hardware problem caused by a broken headset. However, for other users there are software solutions to look into.

## Software problem

There are programs for karaoke sound manipulation where voices are taken out of the music. Check if you have any of these programs installed and running without being requested:

- [Karaoke Mode for YouTube™ - Chrome Web Store][1]
- [Ubuntu Manpage: performous - The free music and rhythm game][2]
- [Ubuntu Manpage: pykaraoke - free CDG/MIDI/MPEG karaoke player][3]
