You have a Cherry Trail processor which is a close cousin to Bay Trail I believe. In any case you are likely suffering from the Bay Trail bug which can be fixed by editing the grub boot loader configuration using:

``` 
sudo nano /etc/default/grub

```

Find the line containing `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"`

Add a space and `intel_idle.max_cstate=1` after `splash` and before the closing double quote.

Save the file and exit the `nano` editor.

Run `sudo update-grub`

Reboot.

Others with your Atom processor didn't have any luck though: https://askubuntu.com/questions/945446/ubuntu-freezes-on-intel-atom

I'm hoping this common solution will work for you though. Search in Ask Ubuntu using `intel_idle.max_cstate=1` for lots of examples.
