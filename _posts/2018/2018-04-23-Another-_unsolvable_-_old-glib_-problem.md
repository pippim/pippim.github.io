Your `dpkg` command doesn't catch everything. Try this command instead:

``` 
$ dpkg -l libglib2*

```

Although my Ubuntu 16.04 works perfectly for my needs it appears I have similar `glib` errors to you. I'll just ignore them though because I don't need to reinstall `glib`:

``` 
$ sudo apt install libglib2.0

libglib2.0-0 is already the newest version (2.48.2-0ubuntu1).
libglib2.0-data is already the newest version (2.48.2-0ubuntu1).
libglib2.0-bin is already the newest version (2.48.2-0ubuntu1).
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 libglib2.0-0-dbg : Depends: libglib2.0-0 (= 2.48.0-1ubuntu4) but 2.48.2-0ubuntu1 is to be installed
 libglib2.0-0-refdbg : Depends: libglib2.0-0 (= 2.48.0-1ubuntu4) but 2.48.2-0ubuntu1 is to be installed

                  Depends: libglib2.0-bin (= 2.48.0-1ubuntu4)
                  Depends: zlib1g-dev but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```

On one hand the messages say the most current version is already installed on the other hand it says incorrect versions are installed. At the end it says there are broken packages.
