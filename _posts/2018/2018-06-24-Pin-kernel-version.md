To prevent the kernel from getting purged by `sudo apt autoremove`, pin the kernel using:

``` 
sudo apt-mark hold linux-image-4.13.0-26-generic linux-headers-4.13.0-26-generic
```

If you boot with version `-26` and run `autoremove` without pinning the kernel first, it still won't be removed because you booted with it. If you boot with the newest kernel version and run `autoremove` then `-26` will be purged if it's not the most recent or the next most recent version installed.
