There are two excellent answers already but I'd like to expand a bit. Copy and paste command below into your terminal:

``` 
$ sleep 3d 5h 7m 30.05s &
[1] 7321

This will start a second process that will sleep for 3 days, 5 hours, 7 minutes and 30.05 seconds. The process ID (PID) is `7321` in my case.
```


To confirm the PID use

``` 
$ ps aux | grep sleep
rick      7321  0.0  0.0  14356   660 pts/2    S    22:40   0:00 sleep 3d 5h 7m 30.05s
root     12415  0.0  0.0  14356   700 ?        S    22:41   0:00 sleep 60
rick     12500  0.0  0.0  21292   968 pts/2    R+   22:41   0:00 grep --color=auto sleep

```

The first entry is the one we are interested in. The second entry is for a permanent program I have running in startup. The third entry is for the grep command itself.

Now to see how much time is remaining (in seconds) for the `sleep` command generated by PID `7321` we can use this: [How to determine the amount of time left in a “sleep”?][1] command: 

``` 
$ remaining_sleep_time 7321
277304.05
$ remaining_sleep_time 7321
277296.05
$ remaining_sleep_time 7321
277262.05

```

The code for the command you can include in your `~/.bashrc` file:



``` bash
remaining_sleep_time() { # arg: pid
  ps -o etime= -o args= -p "$1" | perl -MPOSIX -lane '
    %map = qw(d 86400 h 3600 m 60 s 1);
    $F[0] =~ /(\d+-)?(\d+:)?(\d+):(\d+)/;
    $t = -($4+60*($3+60*($2+24*$1)));
    for (@F[2..$#F]) {
      s/\?//g;
      ($n, $p) = strtod($_);
      $n *= $map{substr($_, -$p)} if $p;
      $t += $n
    }
    print $t'
}

```
