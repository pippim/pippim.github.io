The safest way is to use Windows 10 to shrink it's own partition.

Windows 10 knows more about the last used area of the disk partition. Ubuntu / gparted cannot shrink the partition reliably as Windows 10 can.

For example last weekend I wanted to clone 16.04 and do a test run upgrade to 18.04. My Windows partition was 411 GB with only 100 GB used. Windows 10 would only shrink by a maximum of 25 GB because it saw used files near the end of the partition. If any more was needed Windows 10 would have to defragment the disk.
