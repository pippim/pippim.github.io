Similar messages can appear when you type `reboot` in the command line. The solution is to use `sudo reboot` instead. In your case it would be `sudo poweroff` or `sudo shutdown` which does the same thing. Always make sure you have saved all your work and closed down Libre Office, etc.

The other solution for me is to pick **Reboot** from the system menu. In this case the `sudo` isn't necessary. In you case you would pick **Shutdown** from the system menu.

Lastly, you can do as the message suggests and use:

``` 
systemctl poweroff -i
```
