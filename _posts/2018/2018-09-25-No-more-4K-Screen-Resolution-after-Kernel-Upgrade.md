Rather than reinstalling Ubuntu after a kernel update, boot with the older kernel.

From the Grub menu, select "Advanced Options" and from there you can select your older (original) kernel that works:

[![grub-menu.sh][1]][1]

This image generated by [`grub-menu.sh`][2] that displays your grub menu without rebooting. Your real grub menu would look different during boot.

The original kernel version should still work. Then keep trying out new kernels that Ubuntu installs until the bug is fixed. Then after using the most recent kernel you can remove older kernels using:

``` 
sudo apt autoremove
```
