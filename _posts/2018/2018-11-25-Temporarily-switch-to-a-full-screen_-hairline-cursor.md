There was a [similar question][1] a couple years ago.

The accept answer has four recommendations:

 - [Magnification in GNOME Shell][1]
 - [Zoom Options Dialog (Universal Access)][2]
 - [Gnome Magnifier Review][3]
 - [Cursor as full screen crosshairs][4]

# Best Choice

All four should be investigated but the third suggestion leads to a promising app: [Zoom Options Dialog (Universal Access)][5]:

Figure 2. Zoom Options Dialog showing the "Crosshairs" Tab.

## Crosshairs Switch

The switch labelled Crosshairs toggles the display of crosshairs.

## Overlaps mouse cursor

When the Overlaps mouse cursor checkbox is checked, the crosshairs intersect the mouse pointer. When unchecked, the crosshairs end before intersecting the mouse cursor.

## Thickness

The Thickness slider determines the width of the crosshairs. The range is from 1 to 100 pixels.

## Length

The Length slider determines the length of the crosshairs. The range is from very short, through fractions of the size of the screen, to a length that extends to the edges of the screen.

## Color

The color button launches a color chooser dialog to set the color and transparency of the crosshairs.

# Step by step instructions

[Step by step instructions][7] (using **Gnome 2.2**) were written by the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation). 

Here are a couple of screenshots accompanying the instructions from that site:

----------

Ubuntu Wiki has instructions for installing Orca for Unity and Gnome desktop environments [here][10]. However **Unity** DOES NOT have the Assistive Technology features for Magnifier and Cross Hairs. You MUST use Gnome DE for these features. [Source][11]. 

Zoom Options Dialog is part of the [ÆGIS (Ontario) Project][12]. It is funded and supported by the [Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation][13] and the [ÆGIS (Europe) Project][14]. You can also check these websites for more instructions.
