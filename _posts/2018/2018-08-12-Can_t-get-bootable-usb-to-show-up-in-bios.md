According to: [New XPS 13 (9370) USB Port question][1]

Your laptop will only boot a live USB plugged into the right hand port.

> The ports on the left support Thunderbolt 3; the port on the right  
> does not.  As a result, the left-hand ports may be disabled at boot  
> time unless you enable Thunderbolt boot support in the BIOS.  I would  
> have thought that option would only affect devices that actually try  
> to communicate over the Thunderbolt protocol, but recent threads have  
> indicated that this option also affects whether regular USB-type  
> devices connected to those ports are visible at boot time.
