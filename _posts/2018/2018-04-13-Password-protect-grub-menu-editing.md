Grub is operating as designed. This [article][1] describes it in detail:

> When a menu item requiring a password is selected, the user will be  
> prompted to enter the correct username and password. If entered  
> correctly, the selected menuentry will continue to boot. If incorrect,  
> the user will be returned to the GRUB 2 menu.
