For FIFO pipe speed I'm considering placing it inside the RAM disk called `/dev/shm`. I see there are some files there already:

``` 
$ ll /dev/shm
total 1536
drwxrwxrwt  2 root    root         280 Oct  2 17:19 ./
drwxr-xr-x 22 root    root        4840 Oct  2 05:49 ../

```

Is it safe to assume this directory is universal on all Ubuntu systems or even better all Linux systems?

If the directory doesn't exist I'll create my pipe FIFO file in `/tmp` but hopefully that never happens.
