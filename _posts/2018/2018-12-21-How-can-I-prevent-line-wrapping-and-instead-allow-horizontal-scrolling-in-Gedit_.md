On the window bottom of `gedit` click on the Line number / Column number section:

Uncheck the `Text wrapping` option and a horizontal scroll box will then appear. Lines will no longer be wrapped.


----------


If you want the setting to be permanent change your preferences. Use: `Edit` => `Preverences` => `View` => `Enable text wrapping`:

You can't access preferences if you are using `sudo -H gedit` though. You need to do this with regular user using `gedit` only. Then you can have `sudo` inherit your user preferences with a script such as this: [How can I sync my root gedit with my user gedit&#39;s preferences?](How can I sync my root gedit with my user gedit&#39;s preferences?)
