# Yad works but not Zenity (yet)



I tried doing this with `zenity` but couldn't figure it out. I managed to make it work with `yad` but after a couple of clock days had to turn to google groups to get help from the yad experts. They fixed my one-liner bash code in 12 hours!

If you don't have `yad` installed already you need to use:

``` bash
sudo apt install yad
```

`yad` lets you sort the list by any column in ascending/descending order. You can grab the scroll bar to quickly move up and down the list. The Up/Down arrow, <kbd>PgUp</kbd>, <kbd>PgDn</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> keys navigate as expected.

# The one-liner bash code

Here's the bash one-liner code you can copy and paste into your terminal window:

``` bash
gsettings list-recursively | sed 's/  */\n/;s/  */\n/;s/\&/\&amp;/g' | yad --list --title "gsettings" --item-seperator='\n' --width=1800 --height=800 --wrap-width=600 --column=Group --column=Key --column=Setting --no-markup
```

This is for a 1080p display where the screen is 1920 pixels wide. If your screen is smaller, reduce the size of these arguments:

``` bash
--width=1800 --height=800 --wrap-width=600
```

# Sample output

When the `yad` scroll box opened I:

- Clicked on the `Group` column heading to sort by group. Otherwise the order is random as `gsettings list-recursively` dumps out the database.
- Scrolled down `org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power` section.
- Noticed a `gsettings` I've never seen before but might help me solve suspend problems I've encountered (as highlighted in screen shot below)

# The one-liner pays for itself right away

Here is the new `gsettings` I discovered:

``` bash
$ gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power lid-close-suspend-with-external-monitor
false
```

The `gsettings` contradicts a `systemd` setting I have:

``` bash
$ cat /etc/systemd/logind.conf | grep -i lidswitchdock | grep -vF "#"
HandleLidSwitchDocked=suspend
```

# dconf-editor a complete GUI application

There is also `dconf-editor` a full blown GUI you can use: [What is dconf, what is its function, and how do I use it?][3]

To summarize the link, install it using:

``` bash
sudo apt install dconf-tools
```

The whole link is highly recommended reading and it covers `gsettings` in depth as well.
