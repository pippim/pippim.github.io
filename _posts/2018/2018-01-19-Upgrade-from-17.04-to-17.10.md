I agree with ***guiverc*** good advice about LTS versions. I went from 14.04 to 16.04 and have 18.04 on my to-do list next year. 

There is another option to consider if you are on 17.04 and are reluctant to upgrade to 17.10. 

- You can still get protection from Meltdown security hole by manually installing Kernel version 14.14.13 today. 
- You can get protection from Spectre security hole by manually installing Kernel version 14.14.14 in a day or two when Ubuntu Kernel Team releases it.
- Linux Kernel Team released 14.14.14 yesterday and Ubuntu Team is usually a day or two behind.
