## 8 GB RAM recommended

2 GB of RAM isn't enough for any of the platforms. 3 GB RAM is the minimum plus 1 GB for Emulator = 4 GB minimum. However 8 GB RAM is recommended.

From [Android Studio Requirements][1]:

## Windows

-    Microsoft® Windows® 7/8/10 (32- or 64-bit)
-    **3 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB RAM recommended**; plus 1 GB for the Android Emulator
-    2 GB of available disk space minimum,
-    4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image)
-    1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution

## Mac

-    Mac® OS X® 10.10 (Yosemite) or higher, up to 10.13 (macOS High Sierra)
-    **3 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB RAM recommended**; plus 1 GB for the Android Emulator
-    2 GB of available disk space minimum,
-    4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image)
-    1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution

## Linux

-    GNOME or KDE desktop
-    Tested on Ubuntu® 14.04 LTS, Trusty Tahr (64-bit distribution capable of running 32-bit applications)
-    64-bit distribution capable of running 32-bit applications
-    GNU C Library (glibc) 2.19 or later
-    **3 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB RAM recommended**; plus 1 GB for the Android Emulator
-    2 GB of available disk space minimum,
-    4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image)
-    1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution

**Note:** Probably works with Ubuntu's default Unity desktop which is based on Gnome but Google only says "Gnome" or "KDE" so this needs to be tested.
