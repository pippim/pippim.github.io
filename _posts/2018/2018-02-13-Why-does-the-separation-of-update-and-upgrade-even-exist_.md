## They do separate things for many reasons.

One example is a question I posted and self-answered: [How can PPAs be removed using GUI?][1]. On this screen we want to **remove PPAs** not upgrade the software:

[![Remove PPA.png][2]][2]

After removing a PPA the GUI software automatically runs `sudo apt update`. If you were to remove a PPA from the command line you need to run `sudo apt update` ***after*** removing a PPA from sources list.

### Without a separate `apt update` function there is no way to remove a PPA!.

Another example is you need to run `sudo apt update` from command line to refresh sources. Then you can find out what **could** be upgraded **without** actually upgrading:

``` 
$ apt list --upgradable
Listing... Done
conky-std/xenial 1.10.1-3 amd64 [upgradable from: 1.9.0-4]
google-chrome-stable/stable 65.0.3325.181-1 amd64 [upgradable from: 63.0.3239.132-1]
libxnvctrl0/xenial 390.48-0ubuntu0~gpu16.04.1 amd64 [upgradable from: 387.22-0ubuntu0~gpu16.04.1]
nvidia-settings/xenial 390.48-0ubuntu0~gpu16.04.1 amd64 [upgradable from: 387.22-0ubuntu0~gpu16.04.1]
peek/xenial 1.3.1-0~ppa23~ubuntu16.04.1 amd64 [upgradable from: 1.2.1-0~ppa20~ubuntu16.04.1]
```

Looking at the output you could decide to have a given package "pinned" or "held back" and not upgraded the next time `sudo apt upgrade" is run. If there were a single "update/upgrade" process you would loose these ability.

### Without a separate `apt update` you can't see what would be upgraded!
