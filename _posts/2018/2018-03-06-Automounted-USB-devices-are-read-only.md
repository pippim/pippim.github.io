# Problem appears to have gone away

This is a 5 y/o question on short term release Ubuntu 12.10. The `dmesg` link is no longer available in the OP's question. But if I plug in a Ubuntu 18.04 Live USB with persistent storage `dmesg` reveals:

``` 
$ dmesg | tail -n18

```

Unlike OP implies, there is no warning for read-only. Notice the line:

> **sd 2:0:0:0: [sdb] Write Protect is off**  

Apparently whatever the problem was 5 years ago, it no longer exists today under **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS**. Also for the only other LTS version today, **14.04** I can't remember this being a problem either. Only SD RAM cards come to mind as being read only, which is a different problem altogether.
