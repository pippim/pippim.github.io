A similar question (also a bounty) was asked 8 years ago: [Disable wireless on startup](Disable wireless on startup)

The accepted answer was:

There are so many ways to disable the card. The simplest I would say would be to put:

``` 
sudo ifdown enp0s20f0u3c2 
```

in your `/etc/rc.local` above the line `exit 0`. This should disable the wireless card (replace `wlan0` with your wireless interface card)

If you want to enable/disable on a keyboard press, this thread on Ubuntu Forums explains how to link a keyboard event to a script. If you want it to toggle when you push keys you will have to add some logic to the script. Though the simplest way might be to have one key to enable and another to disable.

down script

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
IFACE=enp0s20f0u3c2
ifconfig ${IFACE} down
```

and up script

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
IFACE=enp0s20f0u3c2
ifconfig ${IFACE} up
```
