## How much SWAP does hibernation really need?

It's a misconception that you need RAM x 2 for SWAP size when you use hibernation. The swap size needs to be the size of **used RAM** not **Installed RAM**. Generally swap size needs to be 2/5th of installed RAM. To find out the bare-minimum amount of RAM needed for use:

``` 
$ cat /sys/power/image_size
3153907712
```

On this 8 GB RAM machine 3 GB minimum is needed to hibernate.

You can tweak the values in `image_size` for a smaller swap size with risk of failure. You can tweak it for a larger swap size and possibly speeding up the hibernation speed.

## 16 MB RAM in 1995, different rules for 16 GB RAM in 2018

In the days when you had 16 MB Ram, x 2 for 32 MB swap on your 720 MB hard drive made sense. A little RAM and HDD history in this [1995 Washington Post article][1].  

23 years later some technical articles from that 1995 (although I didn't find any) might be found to mislead new users. I did however find a 2007 article recommending [SWAP = RAM x 2][2].

Back in 1995 32 MB Swap out of 760 MB HDD was 4% of HDD. Indeed the swap partition may have been used a lot in 1995. Today in 2018, 16 GB RAM x 2 for 32 GB SWAP on your 256 GB SSD doesn't make the same sense as it is taking 13% of SSD. Today my 8 GB SWAP partition isn't being used at all unless I force it to fill it up when testing OOM-Killer: [Google Chrome will take up my memory to the point where it causes my computer to freeze to a near halt. What can I do to prevent this?][3].
