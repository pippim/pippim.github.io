There is a slick on-line [set of videos][1] you can access that replace the downloadable PDF's that seem to be missing for Ubuntu 18.04.

Rather than a name such as **Ubuntu 14.04** or **Ubuntu 16.04** that are referenced in [Karel's Answer][2], the videos simply refer to **Ubuntu Stable**. This could imply 14.04 and 16.04 which are not EOL (End of Life). However when you look at the video for "Switching Tasks" it appears to be geared towards Ubuntu 18.04 under Gnome Interface.

There are three videos provided:

- Launch Applications
- Switching Tasks
- Use Windows and Workspaces

Additionally, there are links to readable topics (with lots of images and/or animations) for common tasks:

- Browse the web
- Change the date, time and timezone
- Change the wallpaper
- Connect to online accounts
- Use the system search
- Use windows and workspaces
- Get online
- Launch applications
- Switch tasks
