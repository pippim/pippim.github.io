You don't hold the power button until the suspend option appears.

You push the power button once and the window panel menu appears.

Then you click and hold the power icon on the window panel.

Optionally you can hold the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key when hitting the power icon (the down arrow) in the top bar, not the physical button.
