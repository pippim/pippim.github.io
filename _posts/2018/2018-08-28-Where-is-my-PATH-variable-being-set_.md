To find all places where `$PATH` environment variable is changed use this:

``` 
sudo grep -rnw --exclude-dir={boot,dev,lib,media,mnt,proc,root,run,sys,/tmp,tmpfs,var} '/' -e "PATH="
```

This will search all directories on your system excluding virtual file system directories. In my case with three distros mounted, 697 files are returned.

A more targeted approach for OP is to search for specific path name. You could look for the program that is setting the unusual part of $PATH containing:

``` 
/usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0_79/bin
```

Run this in the terminal:

``` 
sudo grep -rnw --exclude-dir={boot,dev,lib,media,mnt,proc,root,run,sys,/tmp,tmpfs,var} '/' -e "/usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0_79/bin"
```

If the first directory in the $PATH is not the culprit then search for the last one:

``` 
/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin
```

`grep` will return the name of the script / file that is setting the $PATH.
