## Which Movies123 and which Putlocker?

There are hundreds of fake websites with variations of the names. You should give an explicit web address rather than a generic brand name so people can confirm you are visiting a legit site.

Some "clones" may contain Window's viruses and someday maybe even a Linux virus too!

## Adblock Plus

For the internet in general, and free movie sites in particular, I think Adblock Plus gives best results. With over 500 million downloads (developer's claim) Internet users have it more than any other package.

It is available for both Google Chrome and Firefox. It is installed as an extension in both web browsers.

## Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware)

Please read comments posted by others below for potential negative consequences.  Because it is free the price can't be any better. But as an old saying goes "There is no such thing as a free lunch". That said right now I'm using "free" Ubuntu, Linux, Xrandr, Firefox, gmail, gnome, systemd, plus my own `multi-timer` and `eyesome` I've written and given away.
