9 days ago someone reported getting [this error][1] after upgrading Virtual Box from version 5.1 to 5.2. Their solution below:

I got this error after upgrading from Virtualbox 5.1 to 5.2, as installed on Ubuntu from the Virtualbox PPA. I solved it by purging config files for 5.1 as well as uninstalling virtualbox-dkms 5.1:

``` 
sudo dpkg --purge virtualbox-5.1
sudo dpkg --purge virtualbox-dkms
```

As you are running Kernel 4.10.0-xx you may be interested in this if you upgrade some day: [virtualbox crash on kernel 4.13.0-26](virtualbox crash on kernel 4.13.0-26)
