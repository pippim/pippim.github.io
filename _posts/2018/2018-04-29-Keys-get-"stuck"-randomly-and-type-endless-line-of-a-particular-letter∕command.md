In Ubuntu 18.04 issue this command:

``` 
$ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard repeat
true

```

If the result is `true` then turn off keyboard repeat using this command:

``` 
$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard repeat false

```

The other related commands you can use are:

``` 
$ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard delay
uint32 500
$ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard repeat-interval
uint32 30

```
