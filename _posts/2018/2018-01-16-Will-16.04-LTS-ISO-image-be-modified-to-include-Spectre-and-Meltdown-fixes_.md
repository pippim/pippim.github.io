# Always upgrade after install

Irrespective of Meltdown and Spectre whenever you install from Live USB or DVD (do they still make those?) you should update your Ubuntu and Kernel using:

``` 
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

This will give you the latest fixes for everything including Meltdown and Spectre.

Alternatively if you have modern hardware you might want to consider [upgrading to the newest mainline / stable kernel][1].
