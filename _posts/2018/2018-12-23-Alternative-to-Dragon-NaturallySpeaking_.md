For an updated answer, here is an article from March 2018: [Best Free Linux Speech Recognition Tools – Open Source Software][1].

## Open Source Speech Recognition Tools

- [Mozilla DeepSpeech][2]: TensorFlow implementation of Baidu's DeepSpeech architecture ([website/source][3]).
- [Kaldi][12]: C++ toolkit designed for speech recognition researchers ([website][13]/[source][14]).
- [CMUSphinx][7]: Speech recognition system for mobile and server applications ([website][8]/[source][9]).
- [deepspeech.pytorch][10]: Implementation of DeepSpeech2 using Baidu Warp-CTC ([website/source][11]).
- [Julius][4]: Two-pass large vocabulary continuous speech recognition engine ([website/source][5]).
- [Simon][6]: Flexible speech recognition software.
