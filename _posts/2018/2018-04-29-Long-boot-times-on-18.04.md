I just did a test conversion from 16.04 to 18.04 and did not have this problem. But you can suppress Plymouth by using `sudo` powers to edit the file `/etc/default/grub`. 


``` 
sudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub
```


Look for the line containing:

``` 
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
```

and remove the word `splash` (which causes Plymouth to load).

Then save your file and run

``` 
sudo update-grub
```

Now Plymouth will no longer run on boot. This is a band-aid fix and you should keep searching for a real fix.
