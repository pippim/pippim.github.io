## DKMS installs `gcc` and `make` automatically

`DKMS` (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) automatically installs `gcc` and `make` in order to compile kernel modules from manufacturer's source code. It's often necessary to compile source for some WiFi Drivers, Graphics cards, etc.

``` 
$ gcc --version

You are definitely correct that `git` is not installed by default however I don't consider it a programming language, more of a library system.

## Development Tools included by default

The preferred (IMO) methods of development within the Ubuntu family is using interpretive languages like Bash, Python and Perl. These are all installed by default. With additional GUI interfaces such as `dialog`, `zenity` and `yad` (this one requires manual installation), there is more than enough development tools to keep people busy learning and experimenting.
