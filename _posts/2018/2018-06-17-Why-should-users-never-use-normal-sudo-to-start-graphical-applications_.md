## Ubuntu 19.10 update

As of [Ubuntu 19.10][1], typing `sudo some_command` now has the same effect as typing `sudo -H some_command`. This means the directory for any configuration files touched will be under `/root` directory and not `/home/regular_userID` directory (aka `$HOME`).

This makes this whole Q&A a moot point to a large degree for Ubuntu 19.10 users and greater.

To see whether `sudo` is working like `sudo -H` in your distribution try these short tests:

``` 
$ sudo printenv | grep HOME
HOME=/home/rick

$ sudo -H printenv | grep HOME
HOME=/root
```

As you can see, `sudo` above does not perform like `sudo -H` so using plain `sudo` can harm your user configuration files.

----------


An alternative to `gksu nautilus`, `gksu gedit` or `sudo -H gedit` is to use the `nautilus-admin` add-on. It allows you to browse files and directories with **Nautilus** and then open them as root (Administrator).

Installation is straight forward:

``` 
sudo apt install nautilus-admin
```

Now when you are in Nautilus you'll have an extra option to Edit as administrator:

## `gedit` as root doesn't allow preferences

When you run `gedit` as root you can't use the preferences you've set up as a regular user for tab stops, convert tabs to spaces, font name, font size, line wrap, etc.

To solve this I've written the script `sgedit` to inherit user preferences and apply them to root: [How can I sync my root gedit with my user gedit&#39;s preferences?](How can I sync my root gedit with my user gedit&#39;s preferences?)


-    Call using `sgedit filename1 filename2 ...`
-    Gets user's gedit settings for tab stops, fonts, line-wrap, etc.
-    Elevates to `sudo -H` to preserve file ownership whilst getting root powers.
-    Requests password if last `sudo` has timed out.
-    Gets sudo's gedit settings
-    Compares differences between user and sudo gedit settings
-    Runs gsettings set on the differences only (reduces 174 set commands to a dozen or less. Next time it's run perhaps only one or two changes but often times no changes.
-    Calls `gedit` as a background task such that terminal prompt reappears immediately.
