There can be many reasons for an error and a parent process will often know what specifically went wrong with a child process. As such 0 is used for success and 1 to 255 provides flexibility for failure reason(s).

For example a child process could return:

- `1` File not found
- `2` User not authorized
- `3` File locked by another process
- `4` Connection not active
- `5` Configuration incomplete
- `6` Process cancelled by user

etc, etc.
