File system is for permanent storage of information. You **must** create a file system for permanent storage.

Swap is for temporary storage of information. Swap is **optional** but generally recommended. 

Swap is an extension of RAM (Random Access Memory) which is a much faster form of temporary storage. RAM is mandatory for all computers.
