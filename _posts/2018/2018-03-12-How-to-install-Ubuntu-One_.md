As per [this article][1]:

> In April 2014, Canonical announced that the cloud storage and  
> synchronization features would be shut down at the end of July 31 of  
> 2014, leaving the sign-on features intact.[4]  

It would appear you need to find other cloud services for backup.

The same article lists other services that might interest you:

> The Ubuntu One service was similar to services such as Microsoft  
> OneDrive, iCloud, Dropbox, Google Play Music, Amazon Cloud Player. Its  
> client code was written in Python. It used Twisted for its low-level  
> networking and Protocol Buffers for protocol description. Data was  
> synced over a custom protocol called "u1storage", and stored on Amazon  
> S3.[8]
