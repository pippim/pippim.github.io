I like to use `conky` which can be configured anyway you like:

You can google `conky` and find 787,000 hits. There is something for everyone.

At the top of the display notice "Lock screen: 4 Minutes  Brightness: 2074". These are generated by "Indicator-Sysmonitor" which allows you to display on the systray / application indicator using a bash script.

For a tutorial on setting up "Indicator-Sysmonitor" see: [Can BASH display in systray as application indicator?][2]
