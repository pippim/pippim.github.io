There are two relevant bug reports on the "purple screen" in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Many people have encountered difficulties including myself. However my problem seems different than the two bug reports so there might be more in the future regarding this issue.

Here are the two bug reports:

- [\[regression\] Password accepted but login fails (blank purple screen and mouse pointer only)][1]
- [ \[regression\] Ubuntu 18.04 login screen rejects a valid password on first attempt. Usually works on the second attempt][2]

My problem/solution not in the bug reports was this:

- [Upgrade Ubuntu 16.04 LTS to 18.04 LTS = 5 desktop environments][3]
