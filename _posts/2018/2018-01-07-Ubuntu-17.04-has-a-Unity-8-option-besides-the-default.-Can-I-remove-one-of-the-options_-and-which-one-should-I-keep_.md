    Ubuntu 17.04 has a Unity 8 option besides the default. Can I remove one of the options, and which one should I keep?

# Unity 7 with xorg vs. Unity 8 with mir

According to this [article][1] when you install **Ubuntu 17.04** you will get Unity 7 Desktop with xorg by default or you can log out and try Unity 8 Desktop with mir.

Accordingly if you wanted the newest desktop like requested you would want to delete Unity 7 with xorg but I would not recommend that. There are problems as outlined in the link with Unity 8 and mir whilst Unity 7 and xorg are more stable with a longer track record.

Additionally Unity 8 has been cancelled whilst Unity 7.5 development under Ubuntu 17.04 is still on-going. So one could argue that Unity 7.5 is newer than Unity 8 in some respects.

# Unity 7.5

[Unity 7.5][2] is still ***under active development*** for these Ubuntu versions:


``` 
Distribution    Distribution series     Source package  Version      
Ubuntu          Bionic (18.04)          unity   7.5.0+18.04.20171116-0ubuntu1   
Ubuntu          Artful (17.10)          unity   7.5.0+17.10.20171010-0ubuntu1   
Ubuntu          Zesty (17.04)           unity   7.5.0+17.04.20170407.1-0ubuntu1     
Ubuntu          Yakkety (16.10)         unity   7.5.0+16.10.20161112-0ubuntu1 
```

In comparison I'm currently running Ubuntu 16.04 which is known as `Unity 7.4`.

Hopefully this clears up rather than clouds information already disseminated.
