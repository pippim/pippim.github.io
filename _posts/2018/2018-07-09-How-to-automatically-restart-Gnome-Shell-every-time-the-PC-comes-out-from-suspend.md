Change your script from this:



``` bash
case "${1}" in
    post)
         gnome-shell --replace
;;
esac
```

To this:

``` sh
#!/bin/sh

case $1/$2 in
  pre/*)
    echo "Going to $2..."
    # Place your pre suspend commands here, or `exit 0`
    # if no pre suspend action required
    sleep 1
    ;;
  post/*)
    echo "Waking up from $2..."
    # Place your post suspend (resume) commands here, or `exit 0` 
    # if no post suspend action required
    sleep 2
    gnome-shell --replace
    ;;
esac
```

For sure you are missing `#!/bin/sh` at the top of your script. Most of the rest of the proposed changes are not be necessary but informative.
