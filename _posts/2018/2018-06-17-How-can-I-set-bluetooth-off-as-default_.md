I've tested this and it's persistent across reboots.

Click the bluetooth logo between the keyboard and battery icons on the system tray. Then click the "Bluetooth ON" selection and it changes to "Bluetooth OFF":

----------

After comments I discovered that Ubuntu 18.04 with Gnome interface doesn't work like Ubuntu 16.04 with Unity interface.

The solution is to edit `/etc/default/tlp` and find:

``` 
# Radio devices to disable on startup: bluetooth, wifi, wwan.
# Separate multiple devices with spaces.
#DEVICES_TO_DISABLE_ON_STARTUP="bluetooth wifi wwan"
```

Edit the last line to read:

``` 
DEVICES_TO_DISABLE_ON_STARTUP="bluetooth"
```
