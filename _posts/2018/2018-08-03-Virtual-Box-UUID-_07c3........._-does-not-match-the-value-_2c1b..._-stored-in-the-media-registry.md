# 100 up-vote answer didn't work for me

When I go to the menu: **File → Virtual Media Manager** the **Hard Drives** options are blank so there is nothing to Remove / Release.

# My Error Screen

[![vbox error.png][1]][1]

# Solution

I copied and pasted the error text into `gedit` and formatted lines nicely:

``` 
Machine UUID {89b61270-7d52-483c-bd40-2f14d6905c72}
 - in '/home/rick/VirtualBox VMs/Lubuntu 16.04/Lubuntu 16.04.vbox' doesn't match its 
UUID {3ca76efb-a497-42da-852c-da97a74b421b}
 - in the registry file '/home/rick/.config/VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml'.
```

Then I copied and pasted the filename in the last last line into gedit's File Open prompt. This is a top part of Gedit's newly opened second file window:

``` 
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!--
** DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.
** If you make changes to this file while any VirtualBox related application
** is running, your changes will be overwritten later, without taking effect.
** Use VBoxManage or the VirtualBox Manager GUI to make changes.
-->
<VirtualBox xmlns="http://www.virtualbox.org/" version="1.12-linux">
  <Global>
    <ExtraData>
      <ExtraDataItem name="GUI/DetailsPageBoxes" value="general,system,preview,display,storage,audio,network,usb,sharedFolders,description"/>
      <ExtraDataItem name="GUI/GroupDefinitions/" value="m=3ca76efb-a497-42da-852c-da97a74b421b"/>
```

- Notice it says **"DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE."**. Of course this means I'm about to do just that!
- Now close the running **VirtualBox** application.
- `gedit` gives warning that the file has changed, click the <kbd>Reload</kbd> button.

# Changing `.config/VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml`

Now use Search and replace in the second gedit opened file window <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>. It asks for a search string. 

1. Click the first gedit opened file window.
2. Highlight the UUID string (between the quotes) of the target machine (second UUID). Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to copy.
3. Toggle back to second window and use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to paste in the search field.
4. Click the Replace string field to give it focus.
5. Toggle back to the first gedit window.
6. Highlight the source UUID (first UUID) and use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to copy.
7. Toggle back to the second gedit window and use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to paste in the replace field.
8. Click <kbd>Replace All</kbd> button and two changes are made.
9. Save the second gedit file window.

# VirtualBox now loads copied image

It works fine now with copied image however I forgot to install Guest Additions to the new VirtualBox. 

Why all this trouble and not use `export` from the source machine and `import` on the target machine? Well the source machine was bricked for **Ubuntu Desktop** and **apt-get** so I had to copy the `../VirtualBoxVM` folder to a **Ext4** formatted USB stick. Default **FAT** formatted file system doesn't work because VB disk image is greater than 4 GB. I could also have chosen **NTFS** file system type but I already have lots of those USB sticks around and wanted to try something different.
