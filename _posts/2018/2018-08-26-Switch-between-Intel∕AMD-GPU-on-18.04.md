You should review all of these links.

Additionally you will find many helpful links from other sources:

- [Ubuntu Community AMDGPU-Driver][1]
- [Ubuntu Wiki Hybrid Graphics][2] This introduces you to `switcheroo` which may be the most common method of switching graphics
- [Arch Linux PRIME documentation][3]

All the links are too long to summarize in this answer.


----------

Rather than using `lspci -nn | grep VGA` which will only show your Intel GPU and not your AMD GPU you should try an expanded search using something like this:

``` 
$ lspci -k | grep -EA3 'VGA|Display|3D'
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Skylake Integrated Graphics (rev 06)
	DeviceName:  Onboard IGD
	Subsystem: Dell Skylake Integrated Graphics
	Kernel driver in use: i915
--
01:00.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation GM204M [GeForce GTX 970M] (rev a1)
	Subsystem: Dell GM204M [GeForce GTX 970M]
	Kernel driver in use: nvidia
	Kernel modules: nvidiafb, nouveau, nvidia_384_drm, nvidia_384
