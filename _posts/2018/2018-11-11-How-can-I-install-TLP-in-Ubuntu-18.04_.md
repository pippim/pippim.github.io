You are reading old instructions off the internet. `tlp` is included in Ubuntu's universe repository so all you need to type is:

``` 
sudo apt install tlp
```

If you want to utilize the Radio Wizard also use:

``` 
sudo apt install tlp-rdw
```

Thinkpad users can install optional packages for battery threshold levels:

``` 
sudo apt-get install tp-smapi-dkms acpi-call-dkms
```
