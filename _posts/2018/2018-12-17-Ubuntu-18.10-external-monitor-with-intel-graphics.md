### The short version:

Your laptop's HDMI port is wirred to the nVidia card in Hardware.  No software solution can change this, you need to resort to a mini-DP --> HDMI hardware convertor to make this work.


## TL;DR:
From: [Aero 15X v8 annoyances][1]:

In the answers section this is discovered:

**Note:** My Alienware AW17R3 has the external HDMI port hardwired to the nVidia Geforce GTX970M GPU as well and I cannot use the Intel iGPU to drive the Laptops HDMI external port. The Intel iGPU will only drive the builtin display and Thunderbolt 3 USB-C port which has a DPI-->HDMI adapter ($25) to another external monitor.
