## If you want many pages but not all

You can right click at the bottom of the terminal window and drag your mouse up to the window title bar.

The text will scroll as it is highlighted. After appropriate number of pages are highlighted, press the mouse's right button. A context sensitive menu appears where you can select `copy`.

Move cursor to your editor and right-click again. Now select `paste`.
