Let's take a look at your [system specs][1]:

**CPU**

- Intel Core i5 (3rd Gen) 3230M / 2.6 GHz
- Max Turbo Speed 3.2 GHz
- Number of Cores: Dual-Core
- Cache: 3 MB
- 64-bit Computing: Yes
- Chipset Type: Mobile Intel HM77 Express
- Features: Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0

**RAM**

- Technology: DDR3 SDRAM
- Installed Size: 4 GB
- Max Supported Size: 8 GB
- Form Factor: SO-DIMM 204-pin
- Slots: Qty 2

**Hard Drive**

- Type: HDD
- Capacity: 500 GB

Your system specs meet the minimum requirement for Ubuntu 16.04 as stated in your question.

## Steps to modernize and improve speed

If you use Google Chrome or Firefox the best step you can take is to increase your RAM from 4 GB to 8 GB. A local computer retailer can quickly help you out with that. An additional 4 GB of RAM should cost you about $30 plus installation.

The biggest speed improvement will be upgrading your 500 GB HDD to an SSD. You can take your old HDD, put it in a $25 USB enclosure and use it for backups / slow storage. A 256 GB SSD will cost you $50 to $150 depending on sales and name branding (ie Samsung Evo 850 is name brand).
