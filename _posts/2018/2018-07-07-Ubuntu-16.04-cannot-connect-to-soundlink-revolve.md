As no one has posted an answer yet, I'll post a few solutions to try and it will hopefully inspire others with more experience to post answers.

From ***Unix & Linux*** site there is this Q&A: [How to pair Bose Soundlink Bluetooth using pulseaudio in Linux Mint Debian][1]:

``` 
sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf # Insert lines below & save
[General]

Disable=Socket
Enable=Media,Source,Sink,Gateway

```

Then the commands:

``` 
sudo service bluetooth restart
sudo pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover
sudo pactl load-module module-switch-on-connect

```

# Another method of gathering log info

With Ubuntu 16.04 and greater you can open a terminal and type `journalctl --follow`. Then perform various GUI actions such as bluetooth pairing and see system messages in real-time. This gives you a **systemd** alternative to `dmesg`.

Below is log output from `journalctl --follow` where:

- Bluethooth visibility was turned on
- Sony external speaker was set for pairing
- Attached Motorola phone which was previously paired to speaker was woken up to turn off the phone's bluetooth

### `journalctl` sample log:

{% include copyHeader.html %}
``` 
$ journalctl --follow

There might be other messages the system is generating at the same time that you might to ignore.

## Turning bluetooth speakers on

Using the systray GUI, when clicking the <kbd>Off</kbd> to turn it <kbd>On</kbd> this message appears in the terminal:

``` 
Jul 07 10:14:32 alien bluetoothd[1527]: Unable to get Headset Voice gateway SDP record: Host is down

```

Because the speakers have no microphone so the message is trivial.

# Bose Revolve Soundlink troubleshooting

From [here][3] it suggests:

## Bluetooth Will Not Pair

*Your Bluetooth device will not pair to the speaker.*

## Speaker isn't in Bluetooth Mode

Make sure your speaker is in Bluetooth mode by pressing the Bluetooth button on the speaker while it is on. When the speaker is ready to pair, the LED next to the Bluetooth button will flash blue, and, if the voice prompts are on, the speaker will say, "ready to pair".

## Bluetooth isn't Turned on or Enabled on Your Device

Make sure the Bluetooth for your device is turned on or enabled and try to pair it again.

## The Device You are Trying to Connect to the Speaker to may be Out of Range

The speaker's wireless range is 30 feet. Make sure that the device you are trying to connect to the speaker is within that range and try to pair it again.

## There is Something in Between Your Device and the Speaker

Make sure there isn't anything between your device and the speaker, like bodies, walls, etc. and try to pair it again.

## Multiple Paired Devices

Only one device can be connected to the speaker at a time. If there are two devices paired to the speaker, turn off the Bluetooth on the device you don't want to be connected to the speaker and try to pair the device you do want to be connected to the speaker.

## There Have Been Eight Devices Connected to the Speaker

The speaker can only store information about the last eight devices that were paired with it. To select your device, repeatedly press the Bluetooth button on the speaker until you hear the name of your device. If you don't hear your device's name, clear the speaker's device memory. To clear the memory and connect your device, press and hold the Bluetooth button on the speaker until you hear a tone and, if voice prompts are enabled, you will also hear a voice prompt. Then the Bluetooth light will begin flashing blue and you can try to connect your device to the speaker again.

## The Speaker's Motherboard May be Faulty

First, factory reset the speaker by pressing and holding the power button while the speaker is on until the speaker asks you to select a language and there is a flashing blue light. Select a language and try to connect your device to the speaker again. If your device still won't connect to the speaker, consider replacing the motherboards as a last resort.
