`cron` is only one of the running daemons that consume CPU cycles and system resources:

``` 
$ ps -eo 'tty,pid,comm' | grep ^? | grep cron
?          841 cron
?          896 cron
```

For a complete list of all 264 on my system I use:

``` 
ps -eo 'tty,pid,comm' | grep ^?
```


So which deamon runs every 30 minutes? The first google hit is the `chef` deamon (not a cooking thing): [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14905278/chef-daemon-running-every-30-minutes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14905278/chef-daemon-running-every-30-minutes)

If it's not documented you would have to check every single daemon's source code to see how often it run.
