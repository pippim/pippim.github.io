You can copy files within the GUI using the Nautilus file manager (now called "Files") built into Ubuntu.

As far as using a GUI to change file permissions the only program I've found is called [Eiciel][1]. I've never used the program and can not vouch for it.

Here's a screenshot from the Developer's page:
