Ubuntu is compatible with most of the laptops out there. Beware that some with AMD CPUs / GPUs might require extra work or not perform as well since they don't seem to be part of the Linux Consortium like Intel or even nVidia. This is an impression not the Gospel Truth.

You can buy laptops with Ubuntu pre-installed if you think that is wise:

Google (search engine anyways) is your friend.
