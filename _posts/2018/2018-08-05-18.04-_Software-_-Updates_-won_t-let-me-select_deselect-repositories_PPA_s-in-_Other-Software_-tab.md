I found this article, [21 Best things to do after installing Ubuntu 18.04][1]. From it this advise:

## 2.  Enable Additional Repositories

> Ubuntu doesn’t come, by default, with enabling additional  
> repositories. Before updating and upgrading your Ubuntu system must  
> allow the additional canonical repositories.  To do so, search for  
> software & update. In the other software tab, enables “Canonical  
> Partners.” Now close the window, ignore if it says reload.  

Disagreeing with the author a bit, when it says it wants to reload and asks for admin password, I have the habit of complying.

Also a bonus picture :):

## Another Option to try

If memory serves me correctly I ran into a similar problem with Ubuntu 16.04 under Unity but can't say for sure. If the author's recommendation doesn't fix the problem, then in the picture above click on the preceding tab `Ubuntu Software`. Now eusure the options for **(universe)** and **(multiverse)** are checked.
