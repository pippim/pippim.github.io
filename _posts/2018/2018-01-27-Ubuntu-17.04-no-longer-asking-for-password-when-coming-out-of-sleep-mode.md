# Step 1 is Screensaver installed?

The password when resuming from suspend is based on lock screen screen and lock screen is based upon screen saver. To check screen saver use `apt list --installed | grep saver`:

``` 

WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with caution in scripts.

gnome-screensaver/xenial,now 3.6.1-7ubuntu4 amd64 [installed]
```

If you don't see a screen saver above then use:

``` 
sudo apt install gnome-screensaver
```

# Step 2 is lock screen enabled?

Lock screen needs to be enabled:

``` 
gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen
false
```

If result is `true` then use:

``` 
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen false
```
