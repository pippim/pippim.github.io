Try using:

``` 
sudo apt install -f
```

Do not add `upstart` to the end.

You should not be trying to install `upstart` in the first place because `systemd` is the preferred system of booting and monitoring your system.

What you probably intend to do is:

``` 
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

But as the error message states run `sudo apt install -f` all by itself first.
