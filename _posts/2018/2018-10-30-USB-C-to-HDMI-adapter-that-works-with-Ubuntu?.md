I did research last year for the most popular Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter I could find. Like some users my first adapter did not plug in tightly and signal could shutoff on it's own. The Vendor actually reached out to me before I could complain with a customer satisfaction survey. I told them the problem and a new one arrived in a few days and I'm still using it.
