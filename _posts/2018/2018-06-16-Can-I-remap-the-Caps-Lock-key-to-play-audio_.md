In Ubuntu 16.04 after spending hours googling & fiddling with `dconf-editor` and `xbindkeys` I found an extremely easy solution:

- Very quick setup in 2 minutes
- Only xdotool needs to be installed
- No scripts necessary
- Caps lock is still recognized but doesn't toggle letter case
- Works with standard Ubuntu Keyboard Custom Shortcut Settings

----------


If you need Gnome `XF86AudioPlay` support you need `xdotool` (not needed for **VLC** as OP stipulates):

``` 
sudo apt install xdotool
```

Now here's the tricky part. Every time you press the <kbd>Caps LocK</kbd> key to toggle the music between Play and Pause, capital letters also toggle off and on.

Use this method to turn off Caps Lock toggling while still keeping key active:

``` 
setxkbmap -option caps:none
```

## Music players that adhere to Gnome

Then in Ubuntu 16.04 go into *Settings >> Keyboard >> Shortcuts >> Custom Shortcuts*:

[![audio pause-play shortcut.png][1]][1]

- Set the *name* to `Audio Play`
- Set the *command* to `xdotool key XF86AudioPlay`
- Then click the <kbd>Apply</kbd> button

After adding the new option the assigned shortcut key will read **Disabled**. Click on **Disabled** and when prompted for key to assign press the <kbd>Caps LocK</kbd> key.

## Music players like VLC

Follow the steps for Gnome in the previous section but for the *command* use this instead:

``` 
qdbus org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.vlc /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player.PlayPause
```

**VLC** won't recognize media keys: [How to make the keyboard media keys to work with VLC globally?](How to make the keyboard media keys to work with VLC globally?)y even when built into the keyboard. Therefor the custom keyboard shortcut to XF86AudioPlay is useless with `xdotool`.

## Deactivating caps lock permanently

Next step is to make this `setxkbmap -option caps:none` persistent across reboots. Googling results in this answer by Terdon: [Save setxkbdmap settings][2]:



An easy way would be to add the command to your `$HOME/.profile` file (you can create it if it doesn't exist):

``` 
setxkbmap -option caps:none
```

That should make it run every time you log in.

**Note** that you should use `$HOME/.profile` rather than `$HOME/.bash_profile`, `$HOME/.bashrc` or some other similar file. This is because this setting should be read by your login manager.
