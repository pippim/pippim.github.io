Whilst watching video one core will spike to 100% for a few moments drop off and then another core will spike to 100%.

Other points:

- CPU MHz running over 3000 Mhz (3 GHz) when it is normally around 1000 MHz
- Temperature about 20 degrees Celsius above normal.

# Narrowing it down

While writing this question I accidentally closed the chrome tab with the video on external monitor. CPU frequencies and load dropped to normal. I've noticed before how `apt-get` will spike a single CPU to 100% but this problem is nothing like that.

The process causing abnormal behaviour is `chrome` but what steps can be taken to narrow it down? ie Can a certain sub-process be identified within video codec-land (whatever you call it) and targeted for bug reporting?

## Chrome Version

Version 63.0.3239.132 (Official Build) (64-bit)
