The `uptime` command lists load average for the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes:

``` 
$ uptime
 05:49:47 up  8:40,  1 user,  load average: 3.38, 2.16, 1.87
```

The load needs to be divided by number of CPUs. For example my system is a quad core (4 CPUs) Hyper threading (2 threads per CPU) so I need to divide by 8. The 5 minute load average of 2.16 is really .27 or about 27%.
