**Note:** If you can't boot Ubuntu at all, use a Live USB to boot Ubuntu, select "Try before installing" and perform steps below.


----------


After booting the hard way, open a terminal with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> and install [boot-repair][1]:

``` 
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair
```

Then type `boot-repair` and a menu will appear:

Select the recommended option.

If your system boots normally after recommended repair great. If not post the link to the problems reported.
