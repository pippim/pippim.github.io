Spooling is a fairly old school term. Nowadays you'll see "Print Queue" used more often.

To Queue is a British saying to "wait in line". So print jobs are "queued", ie waiting in line to print.

After a job has finished spooling (there can be long "thinking" times between print lines), then it is printed, generally in a FIFO basis but Print Job priority can override it.

Print spools and queues can be paused for Operators to change paper. The can also be restarted if some pages were damaged.
