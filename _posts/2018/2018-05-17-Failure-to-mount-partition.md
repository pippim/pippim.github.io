Try this:

``` 
sudo mkdir /mnt/stuff
sudo mount -t auto /dev/sda1 /mnt/stuff
```

Then do what you want to with the "stuff" and when finished use:

``` 
sudo umount -l /mnt/stuff
sudo rm -d /mnt/stuff
```

This is from an interactive script I wrote last week: [Unable to read files between two distros]({% post_url /2018/2018-05-11-Unable-to-read-files-between-two-distros %})
