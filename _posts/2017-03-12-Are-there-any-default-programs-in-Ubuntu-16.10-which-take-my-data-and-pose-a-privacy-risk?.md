One answer can be found here: [Ubuntu Spyware: What to Do?][1]. The article is written by our famous friend Richard Stallman. To summarize:

> Since Ubuntu version 16.04, the spyware search facility is now  
> disabled by default. It appears that the campaign of pressure launched  
> by this article has been partly successful. Nonetheless, offering the  
> spyware search facility as an option is still a problem, as explained  
> below. Ubuntu should make the network search a command users can  
> execute from time to time, not a semipermanent option for users to  
> enable (and probably forget).  
>   
> Even though the factual situation described in the rest of this page  
> has partly changed, the page is still important. This example should  
> teach our community not to do such things again, but in order for that  
> to happen, we must continue to talk about it.
