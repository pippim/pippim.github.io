I'm developing some scripts. One for the [annoying speaker beep regression][1] that popped in Ubuntu 16.04 even though `pcspkr` is blacklisted. Another to fix a [PulseAudio 8.0 bug in Ubuntu 16.04][2] where sound switches off from TV to the laptop.

What is the best directory to put my bash scripts in?

I've searched the Q&A database but I get a bunch of different answers for a bunch of different scenarios.

`/usr/local` has been recommended by one person because it's in the PATH$. Is that the right thing to do?

Thank you for your advice.

Even though I accepted below answer over a year ago, I ended up using:

- `/usr/local/bin` for scripts needing sudo powers
- `/home/me/bin` for scripts running at user level

After creating directory `/home/me/bin` you need to log out and in again for it to get into your PATH.
