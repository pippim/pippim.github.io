There is a Google Chrome cleanup tool: [chrome/cleanup-tool/][1] to remove malware, fix crashes, unusual startup pages or toolbars, unexpected ads you can't get rid of, or otherwise changing your browsing experience. But the link only provides a download option for Windows.

Is there something similar for Ubuntu (Linux)? The reason I need it is I had cleaned out my Google cache and password lists to fix a problem. Now like some other users Chrome is only remembering my passwords and not User ID so I have to retype them after each boot for every website I use. One of the recommended solutions is to run the clean up tool but as stated I can only find one for Windows.

Does anyone know of something similar for Linux / Ubuntu even if it's only a beta or experimental version?

Please note this is `Chrome` and not `Chromium` as many seem to confuse the two products.
