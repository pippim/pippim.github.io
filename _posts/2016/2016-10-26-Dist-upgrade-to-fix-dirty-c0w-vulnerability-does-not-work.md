Your `uname -rv` reveals your current kernel as:

``` 
3.2.0-87-generic #125-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jun 19 08:25:10 UTC 2015
```

The date is June 19, 2015 -- over one year old!

According to this: [What is dirty COW bug that allows local user to gain administrative access?][1] you should be using `3.2.0-113` I'm not sure how many kernel upgrades you've missed, but probably lots over 16 months (subtracting 87 from 113 = 26).

Since everyone and their dog in the Linux world has heard about `Dirty COW` by now you should put version **3.2.0-113** in ASAP. Until you find out why your Kernel hasn't been upgrading you can install the kernel manually. You didn't use `uname -a` so it's unknown if you are on 32-bit or 64-bit but I'll give the instructions for both.

# Install Dirty COW fix for Ubuntu 32-Bit Generic

Go to: [precise-updates/i386/linux-image-3.2.0-113][2] and select the link for your country to download the file. Your browser may give you a warning message. In Chrome click `Keep`.

The file is usually downloaded to your `~/Downloads` directory but your browser can be user-configured for any location. We'll assume it's `~/Downloads` so type the following:

``` 
cd ~/Downloads
sudo dpkg -i linux-image-3.2.0-113-generic_3.2.0-113.155_i386.deb
rm linux-image-3.2.0-113-generic_3.2.0-113.155_i386.deb
sudo reboot
```

# Install Dirty COW fix for Ubuntu 64-Bit Generic

Go to: [precise-updates/amd64/linux-image-3.2.0-113][3] and select the link for your country to download the file. Your browser may give you a warning message. In Chrome click `Keep`.

The file is usually downloaded to your `~/Downloads` directory but your browser can be user-configured for any location. We'll assume it's `~/Downloads` so type the following:

``` 
cd ~/Downloads
sudo dpkg -i linux-image-3.2.0-113-generic_3.2.0-113.155_amd64.deb
rm linux-image-3.2.0-113-generic_3.2.0-113.155_amd64.deb
sudo reboot
```


----------


After rebooting type `uname -a` to confirm you are on Kernel version `3.2.0-113`.
