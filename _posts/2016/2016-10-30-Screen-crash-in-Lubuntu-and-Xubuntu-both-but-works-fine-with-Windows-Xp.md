The version of Lubuntu you are using died (reached End of Life) yesterday: ([http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2016/07/28/ubuntu-15-10-wily-werewolf-end-of-life-reached-on-july-28-2016/][1])

Given you only have 512MB of Ram I would suggest installing Lubuntu 14.04 or Xubuntu 14.04 instead of their 16.04 counterparts.

If I were you I'd buy a new used computer for a couple hundred dollars that was 100 times better than your current setup and could run Ubuntu 16.04 / 16.10.
