You can read this:

"**v4.7.2 mainline build**

These binary packages represent builds of the mainline or stable Linux kernel tree..."

At this link: [http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.7.2/][1]

Conical isn't obligated to provide us with kernel updates. But when they do they should make sure they are bug free, within reasonable limits.

Quoting the answer by @kenderland above:

"I edited my config to include:

``` 
CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER=y
```

downloaded the kernel and recompiled."

These simple steps are all Conical needs to remove the bug they are publishing on their webpage. A google search reveals others have had to do this too.

Many people are reluctant to upgrade 14.04 to 16.04 at this time due to reported errors. Kernel 4.7.2 installs ok over kernel 4.4 which Ubuntu 16.04 ships with. Some people need the newer kernel version for newer hardware or driver fixes. People shouldn't be forced to upgrade to 16.04 in order to install kernel 4.7.2 nor should they be forced to recompile kernel 4.7.2 under kernel 14.04.

I hope Conical recompiles Linux Kernel 4.7.2 soon and updates their webpage with new links.

At the very least a warning could be on the page" "This Kernel Version is only compatible with Ubuntu 16.04 or 16.10".

FTR I'm happy with 16.04 improvements especially screen tearing but had to fiddle with Conky, PulseAudio and Suspend/Resume a bit.
