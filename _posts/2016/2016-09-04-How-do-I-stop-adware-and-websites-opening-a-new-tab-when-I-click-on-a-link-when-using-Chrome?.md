50 million people and myself are using `Adblock Plus` for Google Chrome. It works with Linux and Windows Chrome.

It will not only block the malware that is plaguing you now but also normal pop-up ads that appear on many websites you visit.

Near the top right of you chrome screen you will see three vertical dots. When you hover your mouse over it the caption `Customize and control Google Chrome` appears.

Click the three vertical dots and a menu appears. Select `Settings` from the mneu.

On the left side of the Settings menu there is an option called `Extensions`. Click this option.

The Extensions screen shows all the chrome extensions installed. Scan through the list for any suspicious ones and disable or delete them.

Scroll down to the bottom of the Extensions list and you'll see the option `Get more extensions`. Click this option and you'll be taken to the Chrome web store. Type `adblock plus` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

The first three options displayed are `Apps`. We don't want them so scroll down and the next section titled `Extensions` is what we want. `Adblock Plus` appears first as the screenshot below illustrates:

[Adblock Plus][1]

On my screen it shows as already installed but for your screen you would select `+ Add to Chrome`.

`Adblock Plus` is now installed as an Extension.

Should this answer require further explanation post a comment under it.
