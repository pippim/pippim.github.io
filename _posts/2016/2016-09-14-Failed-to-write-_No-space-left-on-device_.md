Your problem isn't the 18GB free on `/`

The problem is:

``` 
/dev/sda1                  236M  226M     0 100% /boot
```

The package installer is working on `/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-91-generic` and there is no space available.

You need to increase the size of this partition.

As Anwar stated in comment a minute ago see: [askubuntu.how-do-i-increase-the-size-of-boot][1]

Originally I said to see the Q&A: [askubuntu.com ..how-to-increase-size-of-boot-partition-using-gparted][2] which is also helpful.
