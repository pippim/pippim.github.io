When you are looking at the CPU% or Load factor you have to divide by the number of CPU Cores x Hyper Threading. So if you have a quad core processor with hyper threading it's in interpreted as 8 CPU's.

If your CPU% shows 200% and it is 8 CPUs then your real CPU usage is 25%.

If your load factor show ".92" and you have 8 CPUs then your real load factor is ".115". In your Conky you would massage your load factor (for 5 minutes, 10 minutes and 15 minutes) by using:

``` 
${execpi .001 (awk '{printf "%s/", $1}' /proc/loadavg; grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo;) | bc -l | cut -c1-4} ${execpi .001 (awk '{printf "%s/", $2}' /proc/loadavg; grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo;) | bc -l | cut -c1-4} ${execpi .001 (awk '{printf "%s/", $3}' /proc/loadavg; grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo;) | bc -l | cut -c1-4}
```

The **Real** CPU percentage can never go over 100% and the **Real** load factor can never go over 1 so you have to mentally do the math dividing by the number of CPUs or use Conky for accurate results instead of `Top` or whatever program you were using.

# Conky vs `top` screen example

Comparing `top` CPU% to Conky's CPU%:

Firefox is consuming the most CPU%. In `top` it is listed at **27.8%** in Conky it is listed at **3.37%**. Taking Conky's percentage and multiplying by 8 (the number of CPUs) yields **27%**.
