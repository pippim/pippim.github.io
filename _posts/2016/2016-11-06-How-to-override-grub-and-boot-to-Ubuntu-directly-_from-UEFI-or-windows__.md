The first step is to install a Windows program to access Linux partitions from within Windows as described here: ([Best way to access ext partion in windows][1])

The next step is to edit `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` and search for `timeout` changing the value from `0` to `5`.

Save the file and reboot.

Note that after rebooting Ubuntu you still need to change `/etc/default/grub` otherwise the next time you run `sudo update-grub` the timeout will go back to zero.
