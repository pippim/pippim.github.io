When you see the recovered document is a very old version, don't save it. Do a `Save As` and give it a unique name.

Then open the original document again and this time don't select the recover option. Hopefully it is more recent. Do `Save As` a different unique name. 

Next search with google on if other recovery options are available. You now have 3 copies of the file:

Original `unrecovered version`

`Recovered version` from first step

Error free saved version of `unrecovered version` from second step.

When things go wrong-- save... Save... SAVE!!!!!
