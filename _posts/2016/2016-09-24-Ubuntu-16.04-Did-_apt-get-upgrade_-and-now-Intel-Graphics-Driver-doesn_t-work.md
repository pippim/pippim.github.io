Nvidia drivers have know complications with Ubuntu. The Intel website you link ([intel-graphics-update-tool-linux-os-v2.0.2][1])lists many known complications with Linux and Ubuntu specifically.

The first step would be to go to `System Settings`, `Software & Updates` and select the `Additional Drivers` screen which looks like this:

**Unknown:Unknown** means **Intel Corporation: {Your CPU}**. If it is turned off then turn it on. If it is turned on then turn it off. Reboot and see if this corrects problem.

The second step is to go to the Intel Graphics Installer forum: [graphics-installer-discussions][3] and post your problem there.

The third step is to remove **Intel Graphics For Linux OS** you installed and use the native i915 driver in Ubuntu instead. This driver should be automatically used after removing the Intel Web Site's driver.
