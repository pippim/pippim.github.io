Someone just posted a question about ASUS Zenbook UX303 in AskUbuntu and I edited the question to add the tag "Zenbook". If the machine is becomes more popular in the future perhaps the tag should be kept? It will never out sell MacBook of course but how do we know how much it will sell going forward?

Definitely new tags should be strenuously vetted but removing a tag gaining traction doesn't seem the right thing to do. Of course if it's something like "IBM PS/2" or "IBM OS/2" go right ahead and delete it.
