Although I use a wireless mouse, I also upgraded from 14.04 to 16.04 on a Dell Inspiron 17R 7720 SE and the two finger scrolling works perfectly (I just tried it). I'm on Kernel version 4.7.5 with Intel microcode updates though and never tested under Kernel 4.4. I just want to let you know it does work on Dell touchpad under 16.04.

There is a screen you need to go to in `System Settings`, `Mouse & Touchpad` to enable `two-finger scrolling` as this screen snapshot illustrates:

## Edit 1 - Synaptics Driver Override


Having verified that `Two finger scroll` is checked and it still doesn't work, we need to dig deeper. Read [wiki.debian.org/SynapticsTouchpad][2]. Where it says:

If **multitouch** doesn't work for you, your hardware may not support it, but you can use the following options to emulate multitouch which allows most of the features to work. Try adding these lines to the `Touchpad` section:

``` 
Option          "EmulateTwoFingerMinZ"  "35"
Option          "EmulateTwoFingerMinW"  "8"
```

Follow the instructions in the link
