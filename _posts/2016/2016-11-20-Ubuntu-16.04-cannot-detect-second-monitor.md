With your Intel Skylake processor others have reported freezing when an external monitor was connected. Some found upgrading to kernel 4.4.25 solved that problem. However since this kernel version is outdated the current version 4.4.33 would be a better.

To install 4.4.33, use:

``` 
cd /tmp
wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.4.33/linux-headers-4.4.33-040433_4.4.33-040433.201611180742_all.deb
wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.4.33/linux-headers-4.4.33-040433-generic_4.4.33-040433.201611180742_amd64.deb
wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.4.33/linux-image-4.4.33-040433-generic_4.4.33-040433.201611180742_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
sudo reboot
```

To improve your question you can list your Nvidia card model number, ie GTX 1060 and Nvidia driver in use, ie 367.57. Also where you obtained the driver, ie `System Settings` -> `Software & Upgrades` -> `Additional Drivers` or Nvidia ppa, etc.

The more information you provide, the better chances of success.

### Edit 1 - Try Intel only settings

Isolate if it's a Nvidia problem or Intel system problem by turning off Nvidia and using Intel graphcis. Run Nvidia's X Server Settings from Dash or the terminal by typing `nvidia-settings`.

Change your settings like so:

Save, Quit and reboot.

If the external monitor doesn't work on reboot we need to focus on Intel microcode, driver configuration, etc. If the external monitor works on reboot we need to focus on Nvidia Driver 375, X-Org serttings, etc.
