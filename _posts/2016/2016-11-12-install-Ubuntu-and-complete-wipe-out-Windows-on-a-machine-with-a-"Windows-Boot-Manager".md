Make sure you save the product key and oem number to resell it if you are wiping it off your machine. Or if you want to reinstall it some day to play games. If you want to resell the machine make a backup of Windows 7.

This [Lenovo support site][1] states you need to press <kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> to invoke BIOS setup at the startup. <kbd>F2</kbd> does not work nor does "ThinkVantage" key.
