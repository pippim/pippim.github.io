Your first step is to find out the name of your notepad / GUI editor / writer program as described in this Q&A: [How does one find out the command line corresponding to GUI app (eg, LibreOffice Writer)?](How does one find out the command line corresponding to GUI app (eg, LibreOffice Writer)?)e In my case I use LibreOffice Write and the command is `libreoffice --writer`.

The next step is to select `Dash` which is the first option on the `Launcher`. In the search field type in `Startup` and select the icon **Startup Applications**. The following window pops up:

Select the `Add` button. And this window appears:

Fill in your writer / program name and pass it the name of your to-do file. This is probably the hardest part to get right and often requires a little experimentation.

Proving that experimentation is needed when using the above example tonight an error was displayed:

Checking the actual file name ends in `.odt` edit the Startup Application profile and change the file name by adding the extension `.odt` and then voila on every boot you get:
