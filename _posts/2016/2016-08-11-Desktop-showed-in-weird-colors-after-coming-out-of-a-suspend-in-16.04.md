dmesg doesn't hold all the answers. Many times I'll look at /var/log/syslog to find errors not listed by dmesg.

Like yourself I also recently upgraded to 16.04 due to solicitation during daily 14.04 updates. I too had "glitches" and the first thing I had to do on my platform was update Kernel from 4.4 to 4.6.3. Still some little things to work out but 16.04 has brought many improvements. Good Luck.
