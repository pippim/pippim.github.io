At first I thought the problem had something to do with your `Linux net-services` revealed by `uname -a` command. I'm on Ubuntu 16.04 desktop so had little hope I could solve these two questions. I read up on the situation from this link: ([redhat.com - Realtime Tuning Guide][1]) that discusses `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/`

## Question 1: How did "debugfs on /sys/kernel/debug" get mounted?

Imagine my surprise learning on my system kernel tracing was also enabled:

``` 
# cat /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled
1
```

Also when I type `mount`, this is one of the lines that appears:

``` 
debugfs on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw,relatime)
```

I rebooted my kernel `4.4.0-47` to `4.4.0-45` then to `4.8.5` and finally to `3.13.0-92`. **ALL** these versions have `/sys/kernel/debug` mounted.

To answer your question (paraphrased) "how did this happen?" -> it happens to everyone.

## Question 2: How do I get rid of it?

To answer your question "how do I get rid of it?", use:

``` 
sudo umount debugfs
```

Note this only works for current session.

## Summary Thoughts

Even though trace is **enabled** on all Ubuntu kernel versions I've tested, it is **not activated** until you tell it to start monitoring a specific event. After an event is activated then it will slow down your CPU.

Basically I would not worry about this...
