A great proposal. I think when down-voting anyone you should give a comment. Indeed I think the software suggests you do so.

We all started with rep zero. We are all human beings with feelings and especially on this platform we should be professional with manners, decorum, proper etiquette and appropriate empathy to others.

I've noticed a occasional condescension from some in the >10k club but maybe they were having an off day. It's really not something you can flag because we live in a free speech society on the internet.

Worse perhaps is a heavy handed mod with the powers to simply delete your post without posting a comment and giving you the chance to say "oops sorry I didn't see that answer had my answer buried inside, I'll go ahead and delete my answer". 

Most of us live busy lives can be exposed to extraordinary stress from time to time (ok most times for some) and make mistakes.

Do unto others....
