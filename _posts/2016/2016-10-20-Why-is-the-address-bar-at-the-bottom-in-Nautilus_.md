The `Other locations` option was created to compliment the left pane of Nautilus. When there are too many items to fit in the left pane they can be placed in a brand new window.

This story describes benefits of `Other locations` in more detail: [other-locations-on-nautilus-gsoc-final-report/][1]

A tutorial to connect via SSH and `Enter Location` from new drop down menu is described here: [files-connect-server-ssh/][3] A screen capture is provided to show the `New Location` feature.
