When upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 my Conky scripts were automatically converted from Conky 1.9 format to new Conky 1.10 format but they were broken and won't run under Conky 1.10. So I downgraded Conky from 1.10 to 1.9 which Ubuntu 14.04 uses.

However I only downgraded `conky-std` and not `conky-all`. Now I want to get nvidia-settings GPU Mhz, Memory Mhz, Memory usage and Temperature statistics in Conky and the easiest method is with `conky-all`: [askubuntu...nvidia-plugin-for-conky][1]

When I try to install older 14.04 version with:

``` 
sudo apt-get install conky-all=1.9.0-4
```

as instructed in: [askubuntu...how-to-downgrade-a-package-via-apt-get][2], I get the bad news:

``` 
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Version '1.9.0-4' for 'conky-all' was not found
```

This didn't happen a few weeks ago when I purged `conky-all 1.10.1-3` and installed `conky-std 1.9.0-4` and froze it.

On the page: [ubuntu.com/trusty/conky-all][3] under Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) the `conky-all 1.9.0-4` version exists and relevant documentation is all there so it's not as if support for Trusty package is gone.

`apt-cache policy conky-all` reveals:

``` 
conky-all:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 1.10.1-3
  Version table:
     1.10.1-3 500
        500 http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/universe amd64 Packages
```

`apt-cache policy conky-std` reveals:

``` 
conky-std:
  Installed: 1.9.0-4
  Candidate: 1.10.1-3
  Version table:
     1.10.1-3 500
        500 http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/universe amd64 Packages
 *** 1.9.0-4 100
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
```

 1. Should I manually go about installing it outside of apt-get? 
 2. Should I link to a different PPA and apt-get that way?
 3. Are the Ubuntu packages temporarily broken and only showing `conky-all` version 1.10 today and will be fixed tomorrow? (yeah wishful thinking of a procrastinator).

Thanks to any conky experts that may be watching out there!
