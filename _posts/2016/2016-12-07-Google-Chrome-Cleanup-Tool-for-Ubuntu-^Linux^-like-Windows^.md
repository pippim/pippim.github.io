The problem of Google Chrome not auto-logging into websites was caused by an outdated copy of Chrome residing in a Windows 7 partition. When I logged onto Windows 7 a few days ago I was prompted that Chrome was out of date there and needed to be upgraded.

After upgrading Windows 7 version of Google Chrome the Old User ID's and Passwords in Google gmail, AskUbuntu stack exchange and other sites automagically started working again. I suspect this only happens when `Google Sync` option is implemented across platforms.

I hope this helps others in similar situations.
