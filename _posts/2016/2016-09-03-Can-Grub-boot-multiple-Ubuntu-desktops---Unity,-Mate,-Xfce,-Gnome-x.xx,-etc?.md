I started using Ubuntu at version 14.04 in 2014 with the default desktop called `Unity` I believe. In AskUbuntu I've seen references to other desktops such as `Mate`, `Xfce`, `Gnome version x.xx`. It piqued my curiosity and I would like to try these other desktops but don't want to set them up on a new partition along with another full copy of Ubuntu.

Is it possible to have alternate Ubuntu desktops in my base Ubuntu installation and then choose between them, either without rebooting or rebooting and using grub to select between them?

I could be asking the wrong question because basically I want to keep my Documents, Downloads, Conky, Xorg, cron and various configuration options as is without replication. Maybe multiple partitions of 8 GB or so containing various Ubuntu distros is easier multi-booting using Grub than multiple desktops.
