Looking at the link you followed to **lock the screen on lid close** you need to follow these steps to have a regular `suspend` when the lid is closed.


----------


## Set Ubuntu Power Settings


From the Launcher select the cog for `System Settings`. Click the icon `Power` and this screen appears:

[![Power Suspend][1]][1]

Look at the line `When lid is closed` and set the options as they appear above to `Suspend`.

Close the window.

----------


## Set systemd logind.conf settings


Invoke the `Terminal` by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>. Edit the systemd logind.conf file by typing:

``` 
gksu gedit /etc/systemd/logind.conf
```

Look for these two lines and change them to look like this:

``` 
HandleLidSwitch=suspend
HandleLidSwitchDocked=suspend
```

You might have to change `ignore` or `lock` to read `suspend`. You might have to remove a leading `#`.

Save the file and quit `gedit`. After ensuring no applications (like word processor, spreadsheet, etc.) have files open type into the terminal:

``` 
sudo reboot
```

Voila! everything is reversed and your system will operate as you expect.
