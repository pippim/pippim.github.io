In your BIOS setup there can be a setting to `Wake on LAN` or `Wake on USB`. If these are on turn them off and see if that fixes the problem.

I've also found that a bad USB cable connected to a powered-hub can generate error messages in dmesg but I'm not sure if that would wake up the system.

## Update February 8, 2020

These lines in your log file:

``` 
Running hook /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/60_wpa_supplicant suspend suspend:
Failed to connect to non-global ctrl_ifname: (null)  error: No such file or directory
/usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/60_wpa_supplicant suspend suspend: success.
```
Are perhaps the reason `/lib/systemd/system-sleep/wpasupplicant` was created as described in this [discussion][1]. Check if this file exists and if not see this:

- [Not able to suspend because of Failed to connect to non-global ctrl_ifname: (nil) error: No such file or directory](Not able to suspend because of Failed to connect to non-global ctrl_ifname: (nil) error: No such file or directory)
