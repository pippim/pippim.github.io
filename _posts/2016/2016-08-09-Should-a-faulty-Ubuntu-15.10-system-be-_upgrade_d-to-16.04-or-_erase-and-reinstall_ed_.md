You've already backed everything up but sometimes there are custom scripts here and there you forget about. Personally I would try the upgrade route first and see if everything works ok. If not then I would go the clean install route. Ubuntu 16.04 comes with a new kernel (4.4). Ubuntu 15.10 kernel (4.2) will be replaced and it may have been at the heart of your USB problems.

I believe support for Ubuntu 15.10 ended around July 28, 2016.  You should upgrade/clean install 16.04 ASAP even if the USB problems didn't exist.
