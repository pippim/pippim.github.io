Buy or borrow a wireless USB keyboard to see if it's your laptop's keyboard (buy a new one for 25 bucks) or a software problem. There are lots of nice Microsoft and Logitech wireless USB keyboards you might like to buy and keep using, otherwise I'm sure a friend has one you can borrow for an evening.
