Just a shot in the dark but have you tried

``` 
sudo grub-install /dev/sda
```

Your grub and linux are on sdb but your boot is on sda.

Normal grub setup changes are done on sdb but update grub affects sdb only. You need the above command to make the changes on sdb to the boot grub image on sda (boot drive) too.
