Create a new rule in udev by opening the terminal and using:

``` 
gksu gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/50-ac-unplugged.rules
```

(If you are using Ubuntu 18.04 or a newer version `gksu` will not be available by default. In that situation please refer [this question][1]  or use the above command as  `sudo -H gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/50-ac-unplugged.rules`)

Put in the following line:

``` 
SUBSYSTEM=="power_supply", ENV{POWER_SUPPLY_ONLINE}=="0", RUN+="/sbin/shutdown now"
```

Save the file and then restart udev services with:

``` 
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

Save all your work and unplug your power supply.
