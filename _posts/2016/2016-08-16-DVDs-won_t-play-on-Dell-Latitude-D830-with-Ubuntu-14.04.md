This was a problem [two years ago][1] apparently the Dell d830 dvd drive doesn't play nicely with Ubuntu and in the thread they recommend purchasing an external DVD drive. You might have to bite the bullet and buy a new machine. I notice yours only comes with 60, 80, 100, 120 or 160GB hard disk drives and 512MB to 4 GB RAM with a Intel Core 2 Duo processor. It's only worth a hundred bucks. If you want an external DVD player (hooked up to one of your 3 USB ports) you can find one for [$17.80][2]
