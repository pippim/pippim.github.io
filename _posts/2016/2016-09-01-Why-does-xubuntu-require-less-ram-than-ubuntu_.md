Xubuntu uses a 2 dimensional desktop whereas Ubuntu provides a 3 dimensional desktop. As you can imagine representing a desktop in 3 dimensions takes more RAM and adds more complexity to the programming. Complexity makes programs larger which also consumes more RAM.

More specifically Xubuntu uses the xfce desktop whereas Ubuntu uses the gnome desktop. The Xubuntu file manager (file browser) is called Thunar. The Ubuntu file manager is nautilus.
