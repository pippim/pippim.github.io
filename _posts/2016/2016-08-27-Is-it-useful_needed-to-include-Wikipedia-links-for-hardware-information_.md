We seem to be over thinking the linking. 

If an answer to a question is found on a website why not link it? I've been chastised for not including a summary of the link in case the website goes down in the future--which I've done going forward.

The only subconscious trepidation is a better link exists on page 50 of the google search but I only read as far as page 2--the next person posting an answer may include a link from page 50 making me look like an inferior researcher. 

Because most of us are enthusiasts / volunteers, I hope we aren't overly judgmental on links others provided out of their sincerity to help.
