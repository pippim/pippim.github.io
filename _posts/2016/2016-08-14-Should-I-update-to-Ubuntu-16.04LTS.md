You can install Windows and Linux Ubuntu 14.04 AND Linux Ubuntu 16.04 on separate partitions. When you turn on your computer a menu will appear letting you pick which operating system to boot. Furthermore under advanced options you can pick the kernel version that is loaded for Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04.

As a new game developer you'll want to look at the new Vulkan graphcis subsystem under Linux and new DirectX 12 under Windows 10.

As far as Windows BSoD's goes... most users don't have them. If they do they should find out the root cause (drivers, registry glitches, etc) and fix them. Personally I'll buy a Windows 10 laptop with 4k screen that costs $2k today for $400 a couple of years from now and install Linux on it using dual boot.
