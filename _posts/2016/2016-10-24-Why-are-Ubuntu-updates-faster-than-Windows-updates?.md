Well since the question isn't closed yet and no one else has posted an answer I'll throw this out there.

Windows spends an inordinate amount of time thrashing around in the registry. Applications are burdened with GUI sizes larger than in Linux. Code is more bloated. .dll's (Dynamic Link Libraries) are large (and confusing - DLL Hell)
