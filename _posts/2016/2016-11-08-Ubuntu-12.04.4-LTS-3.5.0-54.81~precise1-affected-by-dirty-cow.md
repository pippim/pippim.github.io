Your current kernel version 3.5.0-54.81 was released in July 2014. For over 2 years you have not been receiving bug fixes or security patches.

Kernel 3.2 might **seem** like an earlier version but in reality it is a long term kernel version fully supported until May 2018. See this link for long term kernel releases: ([www.kernel.org releases][1]).

When your 3.5 Kernel reached end of life back in July 2014 you could have switched to 3.2 Kernel LTS back then and in any respect you should do it now.

Of course always keep your previous version on grub's advanced menu option in case you need to reboot with it.
