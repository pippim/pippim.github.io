Open `Nautilus` (file manager) from `Launcher` (icon is a filing cabinet).

Hover mouse over top screen line and select the `Edit` menu.

Then select `Preferences` -> `Views`. Set the icon size according to the screen below:

If your icon size is > 100% set it to 100%. If it's already 100% then obviously set it less than that.
