The solution isn't really intuitive. In both your 16.04 version and 14.04 click on the `Settings` icon in Launcher. Then select `Appearance`. Then pick `Behavior` tab. This screen will appear:

[Settings Appearance Behavior][1]

mark the check box beside `Add show desktop icon to the launcher`

Took me a year to stumble across it myself :)
