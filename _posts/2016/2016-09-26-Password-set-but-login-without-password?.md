You can define an account where a password isn't required to login. Go to `System Settings`, `User Accounts` and call up the user profile. This screen appears:

[![No Password][1]][1]

If `Automatic Login` is set `ON` then no password is required to log on.

## Edit 1 - Login without Password


As [https://askubuntu.com/users/367990/byte-commander][2] pointed out in comments you can click on a user's password and this screen will appear:

[![No Password Required][3]][3]

Click on the `Action` drop down menu and select `Log in without a password`
