# Chrome can use a lot of RAM

When Chrome window has focus press <kbd>Shift</kbd>>+<kbd>Esc</kbd> to bring up process manager:

I've ententionally narrowed the Task name width to hide my gmail inbox name but you can see it is using over 400 MB of RAM. In this screen Chrome is using **1.7 GB** of RAM simply surfing the net with 10 Tabs opened.

Your screen only shows the `Chrome` name but this screen shows each opened `Tab` name to track down the offender. In my case if I wanted to free up RAM I would close `gamil.com`. 

The second large RAM user is `Earth-Sunrise` website that has a comment section. Some websites with comment sections can burn up lots of RAM, in testing over 1 GB per tab over a few hours. Simpy refreshing the Tab brings the usage back down to ~100 MB.
