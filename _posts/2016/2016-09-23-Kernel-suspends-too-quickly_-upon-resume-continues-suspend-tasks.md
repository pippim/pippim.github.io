## Jun 29/2019 Update

From deleted answer below (poster didn't have enough reputation points to post a comment), a bug report was filed in **Kernel.org Bugzilla**:

- [Bug 203791 - s2idle is happening before user space processes are frozen](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203791)

Another bug report was filed in **Launchpad**:

- [Battery drain during sleep. System suspended before kernel suspends all tasks](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-signed-hwe/+bug/1825636)

## Oct 21/2018 Update

The problem is still here and no matter how much research I've done (mostly repeating previous research) a solution is no closer. Another user reported the same problem today: [Sleep mode drains battery very fast]({% post_url /2018/2018-10-21-Sleep-mode-drains-battery-very-fast %})

In a nutshell you can see my `journalctl -xe` log:

``` 
Oct 21 16:12:28 alien kernel: PM: Syncing filesystems ... done.
Oct 21 16:12:28 alien kernel: PM: Preparing system for sleep (mem)

```

- At `16:12:28` system begins to suspend.
- At `16:13:14` system is resumed but suspend continues by freezing tasks

```

Notice how the system is suspended Feb 24 at 11:30pm then resumed on Feb 25 at 7:40 am. Upon resuming the system immediately goes to "sleep" and then "wakes up".

## Background

**NOTE:** In Ubuntu 16.04 power settings lid close is set to "Suspend" for both battery and Plugged In. 

Within `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` the defaults of "ignore" were changed to `HandleLidSwitch=suspend` and `HandleLidSwitchDocked=suspend`. The reason being an HDMI external TV is connected and if any of these options (or Ubuntu power settings) are set to "ignore" or "do nothing" the system keeps running when lid closed but TV goes blank. Under Ubuntu 14.04 (with no systemd) suspending when lid closed worked as expected.

There has been lots of historical tinkering of acpi-events, pm-utils, gnome-??? and possibly dbus-???. Also experimenting with various suspend methods of freeze and memory.

I honestly can't recall all the different things tried but it seems like I've searched for everything under the sun.

## Relevant contents of /var/log/syslog

Looking at `/var/log/syslog` at 5:05am the system was suspended (by systemd?). At 4:46pm (16:46) systemd resumed but then kernel put laptop to sleep and immediate wakeup. There are lots of weird messages such as "**parent CPU should not be sleeping**".

My concern is other things are starting to break 6 months after this question was originally posted in October 2016. For example, ethernet isn't reconnecting upon waking from suspend and wifi takes over. I've downgraded r8169 driver to r8168 but that hasn't helped things. I've setup network restart but that hasn't helped things, indeed sometimes DNS gets lost.

Here's relevant `/var/log/syslog`:
