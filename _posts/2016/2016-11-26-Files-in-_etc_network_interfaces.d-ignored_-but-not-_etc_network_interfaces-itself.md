## Your Kernel 3.10 is too old for `systemd` [IFF using systemd-v230 or newer][3].

According to `systemd` kernel requirements in github at ([github.com - systemd README][1]) you need version >= 3.12 if you are using `systemd-v230` or newer:

``` 
REQUIREMENTS:
        Linux kernel >= 3.12
        Linux kernel >= 4.2 for unified cgroup hierarchy support
```

Lines 37, 38 and 39 are printed above.

You are running under ARM architecture which I frankly know little about. Google search tells me your `armvl7` is used by Raspberry Pi and is a 32 bit kernel.

## Updating your Kernel to modern times

If you want the latest (**October 21, 2016**) "Dirty COW" security protection ([What is the &quot;Dirty COW&quot; bug, and how can I secure my system against it?][2]) plus a host of other security patches, bug fixes and system improvements (**after your 2013 version**) you should be on kernel 4.4.0-47.

Unfortunately I don't know how to do that for a RaspberryPi. I have linked this question to people who use RaspberryPi and have asked them to critique this answer.
