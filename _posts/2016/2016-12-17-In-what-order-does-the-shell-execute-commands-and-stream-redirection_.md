It's always left to right... except when

Just like in Math we do left to right except multiplication and division is done before addition and subtraction, except operations inside parenthesis (+ -) would be done before multiplication and division.

As per the Bash beginners guide here ([Bash Beginners Guide][1]) there are 8 orders of hierarchy of what comes first (before left to right):

 1. Brace expansion "{}"
 2. Tilde expansion "~"
 3. Shell parameter and variable expression "$"
 4. Command substitution "$(command)"
 5. Arithmetic expression "$((EXPRESSION))"
 6. Process Substitution *what we are talking about here* "<(LIST)" or ">(LIST)"
 7. Word Splitting "'< space>< tab>< newline>'"
 8. File Name Expansion "*", "?", etc.

So it's always left to right... except when...
