Type `sudo visudo` and this screen appears:

``` 
#
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of
# directly modifying this file.
#
# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
#
Defaults        env_reset, timestamp_timeout=120
Defaults        mail_badpass
Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:$

# Host alias specification

# User alias specification

# Cmnd alias specification

# User privilege specification
```


The first command `Defaults env_reset, timestamp_timeout=120` has been modified with a timeout of 120 minutes between having to enter `sudo` password. The normal default is 5 minutes. Although you can change this to a very large number you will still have to enter it once per boot.
