You just installed Ubuntu with the encryption option and forgot to write down your passphrase (or lost the paper you wrote it on).

Because it's a new installation the simplest solution is to install Ubuntu again this time writing down the passphrase for Encryption and keeping it in a safe place. You will lose all the information created since the first installation which hopefully is not very much.

I suggest when you install Ubuntu a second time don't encrypt your data. In the future if you have secret information to encrypt you can do it in a ~/.Private directory or all the /home directory and it's sub-directories. You can encrypt data any time after installation you don't have do to it during installation.
