Conversely if you read an answer that with up-vote(s) don't vote it down because it doesn't meet your literary standards or you think you could have answered it better. That's mean spirited. Add a polite (or at least neutral) comment to the answer instead.

I think greed/envy/judgement is a more likely occurrence with down votes than empathy/sympathy/guilt with up-votes. But I'm new here and might be wrong :). The interesting up/down votes will be on Nov 8/16.
