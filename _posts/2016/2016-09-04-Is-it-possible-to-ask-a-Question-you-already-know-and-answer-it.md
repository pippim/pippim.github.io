If the answer has mass appeal I guess it's ok. But even then not entirely comfortable with it.

What I don't like is when a programmer using some fringe language has already solved his problem of the day and feels he has to share it with the world so he asks the question: "how do I make variable x react when y = z on Sunday"? when he already knows the answer.

He wasted a lot of my time investigating his question only to learn (with exasperation) he's just answered his own question 43 minutes later. The comment I was about to post seeking clarity (after 43 minutes investigating his fringe language) is now irrelevant.

I feel like an unwilling listener to a soapbox nutbar on the corner I can't escape until the walk light engages. Then I double down blaming myself for not wearing my earbuds that day, ie I should have known it was a fake question in the first place and the OP already knew the answer.
