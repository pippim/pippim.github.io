The browser can record your activities in history and cache files.

wget has no memory retention.

That said a browser is more convenient and I don't care if the NSA figures out I downloaded `4.7.2-040702-generic` last week. I use my browser for on-line banking and paypal which is arguably more crucial than the majority of files I can download with wget.
