Someone was recently chatting about using <kbd>Super Key</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>to call up `Explorer` in Ubuntu and I joked "Why don't you use <kbd>Super Key</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>?" (for file manager) but when I tried that combination it was already assigned by Ubuntu for `Files` search.

So then I tried <kbd>Super Key</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> and discovered it wasn't assigned yet. The other chatter had left the chat room so I couldn't ask how it is done. How can I assign <kbd>Super Key</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> to call up Nautilus?
