On your launcher there is something that looks like a filing cabinet. This is called Nautilus. Click on it and you should be able to explore all your drives and the folders/directories within.

Assuming you installed Ubuntu on your 900 GB HDD you'll be seeing it with Nautilus. If you installed Ubuntu on a different drive, like a 128 GB SSD boot drive, you'll still be able to navigate to the 900 GB HDD and see the files there.
