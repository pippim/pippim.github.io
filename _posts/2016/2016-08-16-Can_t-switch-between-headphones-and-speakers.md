I don't think plugging them and unplugging them wears out the jack or port. Having your headphone cables snag on something and rip your smartphone out of your pocket and onto the pavement does cause wear as I've discovered many times.

That said, this [thread][1] discusses many options to achieve what you want. When you read the thread note that Ubuntu uses Pulse Audio and not ALSA.
