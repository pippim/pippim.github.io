Your wired **earphone button** has 4 leads on the male plug which works ok on smartphones that have 4 receptors on the female jack. However most laptops only have 3 receptors on the female jack so the button can't operate.

If you have bluetooth earbuds this link ([Bluetooth headset multimedia buttons])[1] would help you out. Basically it says `/etc/modules-load.d/uinput.conf` needs to contain `uinput`.
