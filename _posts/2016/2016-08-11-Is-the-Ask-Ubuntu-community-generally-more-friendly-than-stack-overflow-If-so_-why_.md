I did a quick check on Stack Overflow questions and most were programmer orientated. On Ask Ubuntu the questions range from neophyte to programmers with most being mid-range experience / skill levels.

Before walking into a bar most people (well not me) try to figure out what social dynamics are inside and if they will be comfortable within.

So.... just expect if you say certain things in Stack Overflow you will be met with hostility just as if you wore a preppy outfit into a biker bar or wore a biker outfit into a business lounge.
