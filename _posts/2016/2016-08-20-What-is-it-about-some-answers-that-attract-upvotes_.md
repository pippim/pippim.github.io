I'm guilty of up-voting your Real Time Clock answer a week ago. I thought the picture of the RTC was hilarious. I could up-vote your USB problem because I suffered something similar using dd to create bootable USB from .ISO file last month.

I think popular up-votes are from common questions everyone has. When I first started working with PC's the current date and time was the first thing you were prompted for and replacing clock watch batteries on the motherboard was common practice.

I didn't up-vote your USB answer (I just read) because I can't remember if I had the exact same problem you had... it was very similar but not a guarantee. Experimenting with the USB again and recreating the problem is not worth the effort of authenticating an up-vote to you from me.

FTR, I think even the most humble appreciate up-votes. However, I want to avoid writing answers tailored to garner votes. I simply want to write honestly, from the heart and using my writing style that is not sexed up in any way. If you can't be yourself on the internet then all those freedoms lost in the real world (due to Big Brother, SJW's, PC or whatever) are now lost digitally too.

HTH.
