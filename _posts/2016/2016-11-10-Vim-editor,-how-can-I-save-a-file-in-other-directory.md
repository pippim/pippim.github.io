On your launcher the second icon is a picture of a filing cabinet. This is called Nautilus (Ubuntu's File Manager).

Select Nautilus and your home directory should open. You should see your file there.

Right click on your file and select 'copy'. Open your email, compose a new message, click on the message body. Then 'right click' and this time select 'Paste'.

These instructions work for Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 but I don't know if 12.04 includes Nautilus.
