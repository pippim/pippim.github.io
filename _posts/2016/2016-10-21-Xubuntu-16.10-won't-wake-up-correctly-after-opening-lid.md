From your file `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` we see these lines:

``` 
#HandleLidSwitch=suspend
HandleLidSwitchDocked=suspend

```

On the first line you need to remove the `#`, save the file and reboot.

You removed the `#` from the second line which suspends the laptop when it  is **docked** ie. plugged into a docking station or when there is a secondary HDMI monitor / TV plugged in.

The first line controls suspending when the laptop is **not docked**.

For others reading this answer keep in mind from the Launcher select `System Settings` and click the `Power` applet and make sure it is also be configured like this:

[![Power Suspend][1]][1]

Notice the `When lid is closed` section. Have the options set to `Suspend`. If either these Power settings or systemd's settings above are set to ignore then suspend will not occur.

Please note the systemd change above may not fix everything. It is one thing that needs to change.
