Open Nautilus.

Navigate to one of the RTF files in question and left single click on it. Not a double click, a single left click to give it focus.

Hover your mouse over the top menu bar to make the "File, Edit..." menu appear then use:

 1. Click `Edit` drop-down menu
 2. Click `Preferences` option
 3. Click `Behavior` tab
 4. Observe the radio option buttons under `Executable Text Files`
 5. Check radio button `View executable text files when they are opened`

Note though when you do this and double click on a Bash Script file it will be opened with the default text editor selected instead of being executed.
