# Yes you can use Kernel 4.8 in Ubuntu 16.04 but..

When the push to upgrade **Ubuntu 14.04** to **16.04** appeared during system updates I went ahead. Immediately I had problems with my laptop and upgraded the kernel from **4.4** to 4.6.3, 4.7.5 and now am using **4.8.1**. Ubuntu 16.10 ships with 4.8.0 one level below.**

As others mentioned previously when you manually install a specific kernel version it's not automatically updated. I don't mind sitting on a version that's working for me though. Manually installed kernels are not automatically removed by Ubuntu system updates giving you the freedom of booting with various versions you've installed. Conversely you need to monitor the size of `/boot` and periodically clean out older versions you no longer want/need:

``` 
rick@dell:~$ ls -l /boot/init*
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 29784512 Sep 14 19:16 /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-92-generic
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 35594578 Sep 14 19:16 /boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-36-generic
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 35599246 Sep 20 17:21 /boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-38-generic
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 44243520 Oct 12 03:43 /boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-42-generic
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 34749637 Sep 14 19:16 /boot/initrd.img-4.6.3-040603-generic
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 34621634 Sep 14 19:16 /boot/initrd.img-4.7.1-040701-generic
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 34620508 Sep 14 19:16 /boot/initrd.img-4.7.2-040702-generic
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 34621988 Sep 18 09:56 /boot/initrd.img-4.7.3-040703-generic
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 42865461 Oct  7 16:52 /boot/initrd.img-4.7.5-040705-generic
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 45625235 Oct  8 15:10 /boot/initrd.img-4.8.1-040801-generic
```

Users of specific hardware are almost forced to upgrade their kernel to fix errors that effect their platform. Typically this is due to new hardware but could also be related to an Intel or Nvidia glitch introduced in the older kernel.

When installing a newer kernel be advised it isn't supported by Ubuntu.

# How to install a newer Kernel

Pictures and more detailed instructions for manually installing a new can be found at: [Ubuntu 15.10: Various &quot;types&quot; of freezes and now unexpected shutdown][1]. A breif summary is provided here.

To see what kernel versions are available for installations type this into your browser address bar:

``` 
http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
```

Scroll down to the kernel version you want to install and click on the link. I'll assume you are on Intel / AMD 64-bit platform and want the generic Kernel version. For myself I want to download `4.8.3` to get the "Dirty Cow" security patch as discussed here: [What is &quot;Dirty COW&quot; bug and How do I protect against that bug?][2].

After selecting the kernel 4.8.3 link I scroll down to the section `Build for amd64 succeeded` and see the following files:

``` 
  linux-headers-4.8.3-040803_4.8.3-040803.201610200531_all.deb
  linux-headers-4.8.3-040803-generic_4.8.3-040803.201610200531_amd64.deb
  linux-headers-4.8.3-040803-lowlatency_4.8.3-040803.201610200531_amd64.deb
  linux-image-4.8.3-040803-generic_4.8.3-040803.201610200531_amd64.deb
  linux-image-4.8.3-040803-lowlatency_4.8.3-040803.201610200531_amd64.deb
```

We don't want "low latency" just "generic" plus "all". First we need to download them to our system using the wget command. Then we need to install them and finally reboot the system:

``` 
cd /tmp
wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.8.3/linux-headers-4.8.3-040803_4.8.3-040803.201610200531_all.deb
wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.8.3/linux-headers-4.8.3-040803-generic_4.8.3-040803.201610200531_amd64.deb
wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.8.3/linux-image-4.8.3-040803-generic_4.8.3-040803.201610200531_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
sudo reboot
```

Remember manually installed Kernels like we've just done, are not automatically deleted by Ubuntu. Ubuntu automatically deletes older kernel versions it installs only keeping the current version and the version previous to it. Therefore monitor the size of your `/boot` directory and periodically remove kernels you manually installed and no longer need. Don't use `rm` (remove) command, follow instructions found using google.
