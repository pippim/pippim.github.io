I had problems booting Ubuntu with USB Hub plugged in. Booting Ubuntu with USB Hub unplugged solved the problem. Then I plugged the USB hub in after booting Ubuntu. This might work for you too.

A few days later I was able to boot Ubuntu with the USB hub plugged in from the beginning and the problem didn't repeat.

HTH.
