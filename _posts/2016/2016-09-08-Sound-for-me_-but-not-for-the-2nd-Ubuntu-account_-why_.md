Did you go into System Settings > Sound and compare the audio profiles between your account and her account?

Here's mine for example:

[![Sound][1]][1]

If her settings are different and you cannot make them like your own update your question with the information.

If you set her settings on this screen the same as yours and she still has no sound, then it might be access rights / permissions to files as I presume you created the setup and her account was added second. This is beyond my pay grade but lots of smart people around here can hopefully solve that problem.
