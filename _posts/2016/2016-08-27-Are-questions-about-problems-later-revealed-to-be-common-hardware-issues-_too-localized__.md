I appreciate your question. The solution might be to still close the localized question and answer(s) but then instead of deleting them move them to a quarantine area. "Low value questions and answers matching your search" would be a clickable option into the quarantine area when searching AskUbuntu.

If localized questions have no answers it is pointless putting them into quarantine area.

I hope a solution similar to quarantine area satisfies your request of not deleting localized Q&A **and** sastisfies AskUbuntu desire not to show localized Q&A.
