You can downgrade Conky to version 1.9. When Ubuntu 16.04 is installed a newer Conky version 1.10 was installed and it broke a lot of scripts for many people (including me).

To see which Conky Version you are running type: `conky -v`.

If you are on 1.10 you follow the answer in this question: [Ubuntu 16.04 apt-get doesn&#39;t provide conky-all from Ubuntu 14.04][1] to install 1.9 `conky-all`.

I doubt Iran is blocking weather websites. They'll probably take a track like Russia of targeting foreign NGO's instead. After all Iran let you into this website and you get to talk to us :)
