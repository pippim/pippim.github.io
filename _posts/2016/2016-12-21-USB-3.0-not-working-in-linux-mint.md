Use whatever text editor to edit the following file as root:

``` 
/etc/default/grub
```

The editor will open showing you the contents of grub configuration file. Search for this line:

>     GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"  

Change the line by adding `iommu=soft` and now the line will look like this:

``` 
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash iommu=soft"
```

Save the file and exit text editor.

Now, type to the terminal:

``` 
sudo update-grub
```

Finally, reboot your PC and the recommended change takes effect. Hopefully all your USB 3 ports are working now.

Besides the recommendation you were seeking help on I would look in your BIOS and carefully examine all USB related options.
