I get lost in askubuntu reading Q&A and experimenting with recommended code snippets. So I often miss switching TV news channels on the internet at the top of the hour. Not a big problem for youtube channels that allow time-shifting, but it's a "show stopper" for tv channels using flash player.

Can `cron` be configured to run a job at the top of each hour where I provide a script to sound a grandfather like clock chime (with subtle sound volume of course!)? A minor chime could be sounded at the bottom of the hour too. I'm sure I can locate suitable `.ogg` or `.oga` files on the net and I know I can use `ogg123` to play them. I just don't know if `cron` could do it. I know I could use a script that sleeps and wakes up to test time but don't like the thought of having something running all the time (there's enough of that going on already I think).

If this can be done with `cron` can someone answer how to set it up?

Thank you.
