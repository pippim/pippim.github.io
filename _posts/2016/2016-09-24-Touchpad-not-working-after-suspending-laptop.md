This bug is reported in launchpad: [Elantech touchpad stops working after suspend][1]. After suspend the OP tries `# modprobe -r psmouse` and `# modprobe psmouse` and it doesn't work. But what if **psmouse** was removed before suspend and inserted after suspend? 

If this works manually then you can automate by creating a new file in the  `/lib/systemd/system-sleep/` directory containing:

``` sh
#!/bin/sh

case $1/$2 in
  pre/*)
    echo "Going to $2..."
    # Place your pre suspend commands here, or `exit 0` if no pre suspend action required
    modprobe -r psmouse
    ;;
  post/*)
    echo "Waking up from $2..."
    # Place your post suspend (resume) commands here, or `exit 0` if no post suspend action required
    sleep 2
    modprobe psmouse
    ;;
esac
```

It is known after a suspend the **psmouse** module can't be removed. We also know it can be removed and inserted before a suspend. So this technique removes it before suspend. After resume insert it and hopefully the kernel won't reject it.

The `sleep 2` command is from my own problems where systemd and kernel (via gnome or APM) were both sleeping and waking up. I needed to redirect pulseaudio sound back to the TV due to a bug introduced in Ubuntu 16.04/pulseaudio 8.0. The 2 second delay was necessary for kernel and systemd to finish waking up. Still haven't figured out the dual suspend and dual resume yet....
