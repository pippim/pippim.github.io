The same problems with your Dell Inspiron 530 have been reported with Windows users in the past and the solution was to update the BIOS.

This link [4GB Installed 2.75GB Usable][1] describes what others encountered.

Your BIOS was released in 2009 but was updated in 2012 under version number 1.0.18.

You can download the latest BIOS from: [inspiron-530/drivers][2]. Sorry it's the Dell Canada website, but a US website should have the same if not newer driver.

The BIOS update is an .exe file that doesn't run under Linux. There are many tutorials on how to `Flash BIOS under Linux` on google searches. However in this case the link to Dell: [Updating the Dell BIOS in Linux and Ubuntu Environments][3] is probably the best one to start with.
