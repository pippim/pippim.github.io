I have two similar cache files on my system:

``` 
~$ l ~/.cache/wallpaper
0_5_1920_1080_68dd513142fc5b210b72f532465b3450
1_5_1920_1080_68dd513142fc5b210b72f532465b3450
```

Using Nautilus I can see they are two images from the regular wallpaper that cycles every 30 minutes or so on my screen. They are not the currently mounted wallpaper image on my desktop though. As they are copies of images displayed a few hours ago, I simply deleted them with no ill-effect.
