In this answer ([How can I remove the first line of a file with sed?][1]) there are two ways to delete the first record in a file:

``` 
sed '1d' $file >> headerless.txt
```

** ----------------  OR ----------------**

``` 
tail -n +2 $file >> headerless.txt
```

Personally I think the `tail` option is cosmetically more pleasing and more readable but probably because I'm sed-challenged.

Which method is fastest?
