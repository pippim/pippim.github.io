Your intentional hack starts with this:

 1. When grub2 menu opens press 'e' to edit the linux start options

But you can password protect the `e` option as discussed here: [How to add the GRUB password protection to the OS load process instead of when editing boot options][1]

You can take the extra step of encrypting the grub password as discussed in the link. Indeed with perhaps 3% of the population (wild guess) using Linux / Ubuntu at home it's a good idea for System Administrators to protect against the `e` function on production systems at work. I imagine if Ubuntu is used at work then 30 to 40% would be using it at home too and maybe 10% of those will be learning how to do the `e` on their home systems.

Thanks to your question they have just learned more. With the link above though, System Administrators have another task on their to-do list to protect production environments.
