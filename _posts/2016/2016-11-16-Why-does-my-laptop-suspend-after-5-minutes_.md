You mentioned you checked the power options screen so I'll put add this one even though I don't think it is effecting you, but which you can check nonethelesss:

The only thing I can think of now are gnome settings which you can force off via the terminal:

``` 
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-timeout 0
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-type nothing
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-battery-timeout 0
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-battery-type nothing
```

The value of `0` seconds on lines 1 and 3 turns the function off. The `nothing` feature on lines 2 and 4 are like hitting it was a hammer twice.

If problem persists there are other things in `systemd` to look at such as `xautolock` but the steps above are the most obvious ones to try first.
