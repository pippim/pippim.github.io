Assuming you've tried setting the resolution on your TV with no luck then your next choice is to change the resolution via software with **the Ubuntu Live CD** Advanced Options.

## **Ubuntu CD Advanced Welcome Page Options**


As the CD boots, you can gain access to the advanced page and its options by pressing any key when the small logo appears at the bottom of your screen.

A menu appears with 5 options:

 1. Try Ubuntu without installing.  
 2. Install Ubuntu.    
 3. Check for disk defects.
 4. Test memory.    
 5. Boot from first hard disk.

At the bottom of the screen is a legend indicating to press <kbd>F6</kbd> to override boot options. Here you are presented with the boot command line options where you can override the screen resolutions.


## **Screen Resolutions**


There are a number of resolutions you can try:

``` 
Colour depth	640x480	800x600	1024x768	1280x1024	1400x1050	1600x1200
  8 (256)	      769     771      773         775	
 15 (32K)         784     787      790         793	
 16 (65K)         785     788      791         794         834         884
 24 (16M)         786     789      792         795	
```

If you wanted **SVGA** (800x600) 256 colors you would enter `VGA=771` on the boot command line.

Besides SVGA you can try vanilla **VGA** with option `VGA=769`. Alternatively if your TV is set for max resolution of **1600x1200** with `VGA=864`. Watching the screen change you can decide which is best for you.

There might be other tricks but this is the easiest place to start.
