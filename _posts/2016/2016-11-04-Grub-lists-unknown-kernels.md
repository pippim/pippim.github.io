For a definitive answer of what's installed run this:

``` 
ls /boot/vm*
```

If grub menu doesn't agree with the list then run:

``` 
sudo update-grub
```

When you run:

``` 
uname -r
```

It lists the kernel you booted with which isn't always the newest one you might see in advanced options menu.
