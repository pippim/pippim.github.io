The link your provided is to an Asus Zenbook laptop which has a different ACPI than your Dell Vostro 3350 laptop.

Your laptop keyboard is turned on with `Fn`+`F6` key (according to Google). Simply use these keys together to turn on backlit and cycle through brightness (brighter and brighter until off then on again).

When I bought my used Dell Inspiron 17R SE 7220 the owner told me it didn't have a backlit keyboard which contradicted marketing materials. After purchase I did some research and learned the same `Fn`+`F6` for your Dell works on my laptop too. It seems many users don't know this key combination in the Dell world based on google searches.

Even my Logitech Wireless Backlit Keyboard uses `Fn`+`F6` to turn up key brightness so it seems a quasi-industry standard. 

I didn't answer your question on how to change a file (doesn't exist on my system BTW) but solved your real problem of turning on your backlit keyboard and controlling key brightness. Hopefully saved you a whole bunch of time too.
