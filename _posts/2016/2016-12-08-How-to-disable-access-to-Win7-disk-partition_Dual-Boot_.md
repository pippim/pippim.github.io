## Use `disks` to hide the partition in Ubuntu

You want to remove the Windows 7 partition from the left left pane in Nautilus, where it can be mounted even when it's not in `/etc/fstab`. You want to hide the partition so they don't appear in Nautilus or elsewhere through Ubuntu.

Start `Dash` the first option on the `Launcher`

Type `Disks` and you will see the application `Disks` appear. Click on it.

A screen similar to this appears:

Left click on a Disk. Then left click on the Partition you want to hide.

Right click on the gear (follows the Left Arrow and `-`) and select `Edit Mount Options` and this screen appears:

Uncheck the option `Show in User Interface`.

Click OK and enter password to apply changes. After the next reboot Nautilus won't show the partition. Note that this doesn't erase the partition or delete any data on it.
