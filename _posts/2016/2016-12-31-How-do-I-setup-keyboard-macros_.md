I did some googling and found a program called AutoKey ([Autokey - Linux utility for text substitution hotkeys][4]) near the top of the list.

Rather than a hotkey using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> I chose to assign the abbreviation `kz` which is automatically expanded into `<kbd></kbd>+`.

It is simply installed using:

``` 
sudo apt install autokey-gtk
```

It installs in Launcher and the screen is pretty simple to use:
