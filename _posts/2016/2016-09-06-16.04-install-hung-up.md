I hope you haven't been hung up for 6 hours...

I had read that during Ubuntu 16.04 upgrade you need to press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to access hidden accept buttons to accept the `EULA` (End User License Agreement) for the MS TrueType Fonts. I guess this issue has been around for awhile as these user discuss in May 2014 on the  Ubuntu Forums: [EULA Tab Key][1]

When I upgraded I chose not to install 3rd party stuff to save time so I didn't see the screen and I can't describe it in detail.
