## ethtool

You can change the aggregate speed of the NIC port using `ethtool`.

``` 
$ sudo ethtool -s eth0 speed 10
```

This will set the port to 10MB, for example.

## wondershaper

You can also use the tool `wondershaper` to do it as well. NOTE: Speed should be in kilobits per second.

``` 
$ sudo wondershaper eth1 downspeed upspeed
```

For example:

``` 
$ sudo wondershaper eth0 10000 280
```

## trickle

A 3rd option is `trickle`. Trickle can be used per program by users or as a daemon that throttles the NIC completely.

User mode - [trickle man page][1]

``` 
$ sudo trickle -d 20 -u 20 wget http://www.google.com/bigfile
```

Will throttle 20K/s for both up and down traffic for just this `wget`, everything else will not be limited.

Daemon mode - [trickled man page][2]

In daemon mode, trickled can limit a group of programs to a fixed limit of bandwidth. To start the daemon, run the trickled command:

``` 
$ sudo trickled -d 20 -u 20
```

## pyshaper

A 4th option is `pyshaper`. It's a unique option among the choices in that it includes GUI and it dynamically monitors and sets the bandwidth over time. You can check out the [pyshaper man page][3]for more details.
