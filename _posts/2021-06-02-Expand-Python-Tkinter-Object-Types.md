There is this question to discover existing types:

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27281097/getting-python-tkinter-object-type

However I've just developed tooltips (balloons) I've assigned to some buttons and would like to be able to recall all of them as a unique type. Also down the road I'd like to hand-craft canvas objects which will operate like pseudo buttons with `<enter>`, `<leave>`, `<active>`, `<press>` and `<release>` events. How might I declare a new object type for them?
