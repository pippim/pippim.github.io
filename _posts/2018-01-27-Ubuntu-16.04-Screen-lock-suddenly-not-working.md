# You don't need to install 3rd party package

You can [re-enable lock screen][1] directly from the terminal.

To see if Lock screen is disabled:

``` 
gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen
false

```

If result is `true` then use:

``` 
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen false

```
