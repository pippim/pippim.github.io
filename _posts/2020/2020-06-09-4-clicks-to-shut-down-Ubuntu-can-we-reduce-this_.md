# Sony TV remote suspends laptop via network control

`tvpowered` (TV controls power to the computer) is a bash script that automatically suspends laptop when Sony Bravia TV is powered off. Additionally it will:

- Turn off picture of TV to save power when you are not watching movies on TV.
- Display pop-up bubble when you change volume of TV used for listening to music.


Please note this **only works with Sony Bravia TVs**.

## Overview

When TV is turned off `tvpowered` automatically suspends, hibernates or powers off the laptop. Change the setting of `SCTL` global variable to control which action is taken.

`tvpowered` should be run as a normal user and called in Startup Applications.

Program design is straight forward:

1. Wait for TV to be powered on.
2. Begin fully active operation.
3. Check if TV is powered off. If off go to step 5.
4. Sleep for 3 seconds and repeat step 3.
5. Suspend or Poweroff system when TV is powered off.
6. If resuming from suspend go back to step 1.

In between these steps pop-up bubble messages appear on Desktop and are also logged to `journalctl`:



``` bash
$ journalctl -xe | grep tvpower

Jun 11 18:11:20 tvpowered[27398]: TV is powered on. 'tvpowered' is now waiting for TV to power off.
Jun 11 18:11:47 tvpowered[28229]: TV Powered off. 'systemctl suspend' being called.
Jun 11 18:11:47 tvpowered[28238]: System powered back up. Checking if TV powered on. './tvpowered'.
Jun 11 18:12:26 tvpowered[31672]: TV is powered on. 'tvpowered' is now waiting for TV to power off.
```

## `tvpowered` script

Copy and paste the script into a file on your computer and mark it executable with:

``` bash
chmod a+x /path/to/tvpowered
```

Where `/path/to/` is the directory name you created the file in.

You can also user your file manager (like Nautilus) to make the file executable.

In the script below there are a few constants you will need to set:

``` bash
SCTL=suspend        # systemctl paramater: suspend or poweroff
IP=192.168.0.16     # IP address for Sony TV
PWRD=123            # Password for Sony TV IP Connect
```

#
# DESC: When TV is powered off automatically suspend the laptop.

# UPDT: Jun 10 2020: Make name politically correct for Microsoft guidelines.
#       Change name from 'slave2tv' to 'tvpowered'. Abandon approach of polling
#       i2c, drm, i915, nvidia, xrandr, etc to see if monitor turned off. Setup
#       WiFi on TV instead and use Sony REST API to communicate TV status.

#       Jun 11 2020: Add pop-up bubble status messages. Add dependencies.
#       Add TenMinuteSpam. Add WaitUserSignOn. Add $SCTL constant. Convert
#       in-line code to mainline format.

#       Oct 03 2020: If ethernet disconnected we don't want to suspend.
#       Add TenMinuteSpam. Add WaitUserSignOn. Add $SCTL constant. Convert
#       in-line code to mainline format.

#       Oct 18 2020: If WiFi disconnected we don't want to suspend.

#       Dec 23 2020: After resume turn off picture with power savings.

#       Dec 31 2020: Fast popping bubble messages when volume changes.

## Summary

I was inspired by OP's question and never realized how cumbersome and time-consuming my end of day suspend process used to be:

1. Find where the cursor is on on one of three monitors
2. Navigate to top right of whichever monitor and left click Cog menu
3. Pull mouse down to suspend option
4. Click suspend (being careful not to click shutdown next to it!)
5. Power off Sony TV
6. Power off Toshiba TV

`tvpowered` has eliminated time consuming steps 1. through 4.

## Bonus - Turn of Light Behind TV

For nighttime viewing, there is a light behind the TV. Whenever the laptop goes to sleep, it first shuts off the light.

Create the script `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-down.d/smartplug_off` and place into it:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

# NAME: smartplug_off
# PATH: /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-down.d
# DESC: Turn off smartplug light power for TV light
# DATE: March 7, 2020.

# CALL: Called by Network Manager before going down. Network manager in turn
#       is called by systemd during suspend/hibernate/shutdown

# NOTE: myisp.sh and hs100.sh must be installed for hs100 tp-link power plug.
#       https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/NetworkManager.html

PlugName="192.168.0.15"

status=$(hs100.sh -i "$PlugName" check | cut -f2)
if [ $status == "OFF" ] ; then
    : # Nothing to do already off
elif [ $status == "ON" ] ; then
    hs100.sh -i "$PlugName" off
else
    echo Error hs100.sh not responding check connection and IP "$PlugName".
fi
```
