The `cheese` error messages are similar to those in this report:

- [Webcam not working with cheese (unless sudo-ed)](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/webcam-not-working-with-cheese-unless-sudo-ed/44724)

The solution was to use `sudo` when calling `cheese`.

Other users in the link suggest other packages that work when `cheese` doesn't work.

That said use the following commands to make sure webcam is connected:

``` 
$ sudo apt install hwinfo

$ hwinfo --usb

You can get the much of the same information with `lsbusb -v` but it doesn't concisely provide it the same way.
