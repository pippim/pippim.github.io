As others have mentioned `${_[0]}` is extra typing for `${_}` which in turn can be abbreviated into `$_` as it is most commonly used. 

As mentioned previously it is a variable that contains the last parameter of the last command used. A practical application is like this:

```bash
$ ll /etc/lsb-release
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 105 Feb 20  2019 /etc/lsb-release

$ cat $_
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=16.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=xenial
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS"
```

In the first command the last parameter is `/etc/lsb-release`. In the second command the parameter is `$_`, which repeats `/etc/lsb-release` so you don't have to retype it.
