I'll never easily remember these cryptic command modifiers so I took the [top answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8101776/6929343) and turned it into a function in my `~/.bashrc` file:



``` bash
cgrep() {
    # For files that are arrays 10's of thousands of characters print.
    # Use cpgrep to print 30 characters before and after search pattern.
    if [ $# -eq 2 ] ; then
        # Format was 'cgrep "search string" /path/to/filename'
        grep -o -P ".{0,30}$1.{0,30}" "$2"
    else
        # Format was 'cat /path/to/filename | cgrep "search string"
        grep -o -P ".{0,30}$1.{0,30}"
    fi
} # cgrep()
```

Here's what it looks like in action:

``` bash
$ ll /tmp/rick/scp.Mf7UdS/Mf7UdS.Source

-rw-r--r-- 1 rick rick 25780 Jul  3 19:05 /tmp/rick/scp.Mf7UdS/Mf7UdS.Source

$ cat /tmp/rick/scp.Mf7UdS/Mf7UdS.Source | cgrep "Link to iconic"

1:43:30.3540244000 /mnt/e/bin/Link to iconic S -rwxrwxrwx 777 rick 1000 ri

$ cgrep "Link to iconic" /tmp/rick/scp.Mf7UdS/Mf7UdS.Source

1:43:30.3540244000 /mnt/e/bin/Link to iconic S -rwxrwxrwx 777 rick 1000 ri

```

The file in question is one continuous 25K line and it is hopeless to find what you are looking for using regular `grep`.

Notice the two different ways you can call `cgrep` that parallels `grep` method.

There is a "niftier" way of creating the function where "$2" is only passed when set which would save 4 lines of code. I don't have it handy though. Something like `${parm2} $parm2`. If I find it I'll revise the function and this answer.
