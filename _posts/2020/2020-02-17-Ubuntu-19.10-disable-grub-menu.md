You can't set a grub timeout of `0` but you can set a timeout of `0.1` which is hardly noticeable difference from `0`. First use `sudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub`. Then locate these lines:

``` 
#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false
#GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=countdown
#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0
GRUB_TIMEOUT=0.1
```

Placing a `#` at front makes them a comment. Leave the rest of the line the same in case you need it again. 

The last line is the timeout. Leave that as a regular command (no `#`) but change the value to `0.1`.

Finally run `sudo update-grub` to compile the configuration file into a new grub boot script.

## Bug in grub 2.04

You ***might*** be effected by a bug in Grub 2.04 but I couldn't find a reference with google search. If unable to fix you can downgrade to Grub 2.02 as described in this Q&A:
