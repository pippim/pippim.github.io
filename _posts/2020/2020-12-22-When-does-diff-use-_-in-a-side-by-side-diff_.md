This is the best description of ["incomplete line"][1] I could find:

> When the last line of a file ends with a new line character it is a "complete line". Otherwise it is an "incomplete line".  

For example, suppose F and G are one-byte files that contain just f and g, respectively. Then `diff F G` outputs:

``` 
1c1
< f
\ No newline at end of file
---
> g
\ No newline at end of file
```
