From [Linux Mint forum](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=243925) you need to upgrade your kernel. They recommend 4.10 but personally I like`4.14` because it has five years of support: [How to update kernel to the latest mainline version without any Distro-upgrade?](How to update kernel to the latest mainline version without any Distro-upgrade?)
