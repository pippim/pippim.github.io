QDirStat appears to be only showing the size of files you own. For example `/boot` shows as zero bytes but in reality it would have to have something in it:

For example:

``` 
$ du /boot -s -h

du: cannot read directory '/boot/efi': Permission denied
1.2G	/boot

$ sudo du /boot -s -h
1.3G	/boot
```

Another important consideration is some utilities list the size of the bytes in a file while others list the space a file occupies which is number of bytes rounded up to the block size which is generally 4,096 bytes or 4K.
