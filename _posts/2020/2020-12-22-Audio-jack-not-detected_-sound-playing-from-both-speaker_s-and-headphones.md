Sometimes a Windows Update will leave sound card in an unstable state. Rebooting into Ubuntu inherits that unstable state. By completely shutting down (power off) and cold booting (power on) the sound card is reinitialized.

There are other times when cold booting users have to go to Windows first to turn on sound cards and then reboot into Ubuntu in order for sound to work. This scenario is not ideal and a better fix / patch should be sought.
