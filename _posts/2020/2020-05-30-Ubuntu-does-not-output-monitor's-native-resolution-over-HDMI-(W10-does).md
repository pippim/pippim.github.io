Try 30 Hz refresh and if that works bump to 45 Hz, etc until you find the highest refresh rate that works. 

Not all adapters are created equal. My original only worked fine at 1920x1080 at 60Hz. When I upgraded to a 4K TV it only worked at 30Hz. So I bought a new adapter rated for 60 Hz at 4K but the best I got from it was 54 Hz.
