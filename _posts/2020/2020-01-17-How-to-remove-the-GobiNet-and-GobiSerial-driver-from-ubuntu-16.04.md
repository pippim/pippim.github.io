## Removing drivers

To remove drivers from memory use:

``` 
modprobe -vr GobiSerial
modprobe -vr GobiNet
```

To prevent drivers from loading in the first place see blacklisting:

- [How to blacklist kernel modules?](How to blacklist kernel modules?)

## Gobiserial specific

If your desire is to fix bad drivers then as per this [website][1] you must install firmware updates via Windows, not Linux:

> ### FIRMWARE UPDATE: (Incase you need one)   
> The firmware update has to be done on windows. Insert the device into a windows box, and let it  
> install drivers and enumerate interafaces. Make sure you can see the  
> managment webpage.  

Note the three typos in the original instructions, it's a bad omen....
