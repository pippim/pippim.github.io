Simply use the `ll` command and the [size of directories][1] will be your block size (cluster size in Windows speak):

``` 
$ ll /
total 40972
drwxr-xr-x  25 root root     4096 Apr  8 16:30 ./
drwxr-xr-x  25 root root     4096 Apr  8 16:30 ../
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root     4096 Mar 31 16:44 bin/
drwxr-xr-x   4 root root     4096 Apr  8 16:32 boot/
drwxrwxr-x   2 root root     4096 Aug  2  2018 cdrom/
```

My block size is 4,096 (4K) which is normal for an `ext4` Linux file system. In your case it will be 64K and even a file of 1 byte will take 64K bytes on disk.
