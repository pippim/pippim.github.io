I wrote [iconic][1] that sorts desktop icons by name:

[![iconic main menu.png][2]][2]

In addition to sorting by name you can sort:

- oldest icons first
- newest icons first
- alphabetical ignoring "Link to" prefix
- manually reposition any icon in sort order

Additional benefits:

- evenly space icons
- move icons from primary display to one of two additional displays
- preview changes before applying them
- fix bug where icons disappear when a "hole" is below monitor (caused by some multiple monitor configurations of mixed resolutions)
