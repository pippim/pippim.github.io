Boot into Windows, restart and then select Ubuntu. Windows is powering on a device and leaving it powered up when restarting. Ubuntu is not powering up the device.

After starting Ubuntu open a terminal and use `sudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub`.

Locate the line with:

``` 
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
```

Remove `quiet splash` leaving the double quotes and everything else there.

Save the file, exit editor and run:

``` 
sudo update-grub
```

Now when you start your computer you will see status messages when grub calls Ubuntu. The last status message before computer freezes is the error we need to track down and fix.
