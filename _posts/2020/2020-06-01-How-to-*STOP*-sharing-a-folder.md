You should read all the answers here:

- [How do I completely remove Samba?](How do I completely remove Samba?)

But the solution which seems best is:
``` 
sudo apt -y remove --purge samba samba-common cifs-utils smbclient
sudo rm -rf /var/cache/samba /etc/samba /run/samba /var/lib/samba /var/log/samba
```

If you want to keep samba and only one to uncheck a specific folder see this:

- [How to remove/disable sharing of single folder [SOLVED]](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=184402)

The share definitions are in `/var/lib/samba/usershares`. Open it (as root if necessary) and remove the definition files.
