Some Canadian experts said [35% to 70%][1] will be infected:

In reality no one knows. I can tell you if they contain the spread no more people will be infected. If they don't contain the spread more people will be infected. Steps like Italy took today where only essential work can occur and all business closed except transportation, grocery stores and pharmacies are a desperate attempt at containment that may be too late. That said given recent numbers it appears to have worked for China.

The German Chancellor is wasting her time and ours spewing off meaningless numbers that will only serve to scare citizens of the nation she is supposed to lead. Something better would be her plan to make the homeless self-isolate for 14 days at home if they come into contact with someone who was positive or preemptively positive.

Today the WHO leader said if American governments (Federal, State, County, City, etc) do not act it could be "many, many millions" dead in the USA. Today's US government talk to borrow 40 billion dollars to spend on the pandemic is not a plan.
