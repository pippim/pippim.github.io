I was looking at one of my apps today and wondered if it actually worked to get today's sunrise and sunset times. Conky displays them as 8:46am and 4:36pm respectively but they could be yesterday's times for all I know. I could dig through program code and find what error messages go into `journalctl` if program failed and then manually search for those error messages.

It would be easier if there is an existing app where I put in what messages to watch for and it checks `journalctl` for me. Then it sends a pop-up notification periodically until I acknowledge reading it.

As a bonus the program can keep track of the times a specific error has occurred in a scroll-able database. Maybe for some errors such as NTFS permissions which spam `journalctl` just the count per day, week, month, etc is better and no pop-up notification.

Is there such a program already or do I have to invent the wheel?
