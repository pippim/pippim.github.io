I came across this command whilst setting up `ssh`:



``` bash
$ w

 20:01:30 up 6 days,  2:20,  3 users,  load average: 0.06, 0.11, 0.10
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
rick     tty7     :0               16Jun20  6days 16:51   2.37s /sbin/upstart --user
rick     pts/21   192.168.0.12     18:44    1:14m  0.19s  0.00s sleep 60
rick     pts/22   192.168.0.12     18:45    0.00s  0.44s  0.01s w
```

Which led me to wonder what all the one letter commands are in Ubuntu. I didn't find an exact reference but I found this website:

- [An A-Z Index of the Linux command line: bash + utilities.][1]

Here the `w` command is listed along with:

- `.` the command to source a file which I've used
- `v` is a command not installed in Ubuntu. It is said to be equivalent to `ls -l -b`. This in turn is similar to the the `ll` alias setup by Ubuntu except files beginning with `.` (including the infamous `.` and `..`) are not included.

Are there other one letter commands installed within Ubuntu by default?
