Assuming that return value is `1` for "cancel" and `0` for "ok" you will want to use:

``` sh
#!/bin/sh
#InputBox1Test

title=$(zenity --entry --text 'Type what you want your Notification Title to Say!' --title 'Notification')
[[ "$?" != "0" ]] && exit 1
text=$(zenity --entry --text 'Type what you want your Notification body to Say!' --title 'Notification')
[[ "$?" != "0" ]] && exit 1
DISPLAY=:0.0 notify-send "$title" "$text"
```

You can make a longer traditional check like this:

``` 
if [[ "$?" != "0" ]] ; then
    exit 1
fi
```

however I like the shortcut of:

``` 
[[ "$?" != "0" ]] && exit 1
```

No matter which method you choose the importance is consistency with your programming style so those that follow in your footsteps and maintain your code can think inside your head.
