Here is a very thorough information on nVidia problems and solutions:

- [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA/Troubleshooting][1]

I would start by looking for errors in:

- `/var/log/Xorg.0.log`
- `/var/log/syslog`

Another consideration is the Live USB would be using **nouveau** drivers and your installed version might be using proprietary nVidia drivers. You might want to blacklist the nVidia drivers temporarily and use the default drivers which, given the age of your card should work really well. It's difficult finding a link on how to blacklist nvidia and use nouveau because 99% want the opposite. This comes close though:

- [Blacklist a Nvidia gpu for qemu/kvm passthrough](Blacklist a Nvidia gpu for qemu/kvm passthrough)
