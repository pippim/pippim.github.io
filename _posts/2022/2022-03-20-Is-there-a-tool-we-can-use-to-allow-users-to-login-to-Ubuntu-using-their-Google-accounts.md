No. 

Google isn't running when the Ubuntu sign on screen is presented to you. A global user called "GDM", for **G**nome **D**esktop **M**anager, is the only one signed on and they really aren't even signed on.

A real user must sign on with password and then you could run any program, including google, at start up. But, that defeats the spirit of the question.
