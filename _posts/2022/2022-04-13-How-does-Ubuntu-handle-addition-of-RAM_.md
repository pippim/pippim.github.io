I threw away the 8 GB RAM in my laptop and installed 32 GB of the best RAM available for my laptop. It was almost as good as installing the best NVMe SSD. Not a single problem as long as you go with High Quality manufacturer and the clock timing matches your motherboard.

**Respected RAM dealers will help you find a good match.**
