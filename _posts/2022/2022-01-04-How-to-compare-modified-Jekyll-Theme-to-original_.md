I've modified the Jekyll Cayman theme. How do I track it to the original so I can see when original changes and I need to recopy and modify it?

I tried using `wget` followed by `diff` but the results were nonsensical. Here are the original and modified links that display fine in the browser but appear to be garbage when downloaded with `wget`:

- [Original theme - jekyll-theme-cayman.scss](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman/blob/master/_sass/jekyll-theme-cayman.scss)

- [Modified theme - jekyll-theme-cayman.scss](https://github.com/pippim/pippim.github.io/blob/main/_sass/jekyll-theme-cayman.scss)
