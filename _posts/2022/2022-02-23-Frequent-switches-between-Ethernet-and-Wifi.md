I had a problem last year:

- [Suddenly Ethernet &amp; WiFi won&#39;t co-exist](Suddenly Ethernet &amp; WiFi won&#39;t co-exist)

The solution there could work for you:

---

A script that automatically disables WiFi when Ethernet (Network) is connected:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
export LC_ALL=C

enable_disable_wifi ()
{
    result=$(nmcli dev | grep "ethernet" | grep -w "connected")
    if [ -n "$result" ]; then
        nmcli radio wifi off
    else
        nmcli radio wifi on
    fi
}

if [ "$2" = "up" ]; then
    enable_disable_wifi
fi

if [ "$2" = "down" ]; then
    enable_disable_wifi
fi
```

The script has to be created in a specific directory. After creation mark it executable:

``` 
chmod a+x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/70-wifi-wired-exclusive.sh
```
