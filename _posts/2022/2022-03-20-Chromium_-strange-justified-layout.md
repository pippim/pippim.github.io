Although the problem has been solved and, the OP has posted an answer, others may be interested in a full solution.

Tom's Guide has a very detailed answer:

- [How to reset Google Chrome](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/reset-google-chrome-how-to,news-18821.html "Here&apos;s how to reset Google Chrome to swiftly get rid of browser-hijacking adware")

Although, as the link's hover tool tip reveals, this is to get rid of "browser-hijacking adware", it worked for OP in this situation too.

A summary of steps (see the link for pictures):

1. Click the icon that looks like three vertical dots at the top right of the browser window.
2. Select "Settings" in the drop-down menu.
3. Click "Advanced" in the left-hand navigation bar in the resulting Settings page.
4. Select "Reset and clean up" at the bottom of the expanded menu.
5. Select "Restore settings to their original defaults."
6. Select "Reset settings" in the confirmation pop-up window.

See the article for more detailed instructions.
