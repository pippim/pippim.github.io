A more universal way of [locking the screen](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Session_lock) is using:

``` 
loginctl lock-session
```

## Cron doesn't know the Session ID for `loginctl`

When you use `loginctl lock-session` from the command line, your session ID is already known. For example:

``` shell
$ echo $XDG_SESSION_ID

c2

$ loginctl list-sessions

   SESSION        UID USER             SEAT            
        c2       1000 rick             seat0           

1 sessions listed.
```

The above shows two ways you can get your Session ID from the command line.

This GitHub issue for `loginctl` explains why the variable `XDG_SESSION_ID` is unknown to `systemd`. The same case would apply to `cron`:

- [ "loginctl lock-session" fails when no explicit session passed #6032 ](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/6032)

So from `cron` you could use `loginctl lock-session c2` if you knew your session ID would always be `c2`. An easier way is to use `lock-sessions`.

I tried this on my system and it works. Try using this on your `crontab -e`:

``` 
*/5  *   *  *   *     loginctl lock-sessions
```

Now, every five minutes your screen will lock.
