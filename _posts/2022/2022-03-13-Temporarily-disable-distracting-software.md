The question could be rephrased as: *"I have no self control, could you help me control myself?"*

You could have two user ID's one called `work` and the other called `play`. Installed games could be assigned under ownership of user ID `play` who doesn't allow access to other users.

But what about the internet? There is lots of playing with `facebook`, `twitter`, `adult entertainment` and other websites. However at work, most of us need the internet to access sites like **Ask Ubuntu** and **Google Search**. You cannot block the internet from user `work`.

There is as of yet no internet rating system for "waste of time" and "good use of time" to block certain websites to user ID `work`. Besides at my work place going to **Ask Ubuntu** would be considered a waste of time but going to one of my vendors' websites or customers' websites would be considered a good use of time.

If you do have the time, and I for one don't, of filtering through millions of websites and flag them as *work approved* then this article would help:
