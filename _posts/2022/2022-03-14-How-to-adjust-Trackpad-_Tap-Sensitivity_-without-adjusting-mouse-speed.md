The problem when you type on your keyboard your palm is being detected as touch pad movements.

The solution is rather detailed but documented by Dell:

- [Precision and XPS: Ubuntu General Touchpad or Mouse Issue Fix ðŸ”—](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-ca/000150104/precision-xps-ubuntu-general-touchpad-mouse-issue-fix "This article provides information about the options to improve touchpad and mouse performance running on Ubuntu on a Dell XPS or Precision system.")

Although the article was published less than a year ago it still references Ubuntu 16.04 instead of 20.04. However the programs discussed, `xinput`, `synaptics` and `libinput` remain the same in both versions (Unless you are using Wayland).
