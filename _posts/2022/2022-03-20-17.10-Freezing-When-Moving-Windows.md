It's difficult answering a question about Ubuntu `17.10` when the real person now is using `18.04 and `20.04`.

The platform is `QT` and there are know bugs with HiDPI monitors and scaling:

- [Moving QMPlay2 window to another display breaks playback](https://github.com/zaps166/QMPlay2/issues/155 "Without HiDPI mode is OK, but in HiDPI mode it can be annoying")

This is just one example of many QT bugs out in the "wild". Personally I use Tkinter instead and am quite pleased with it. Lately though I've branched into JavaScript for a more global audience.

In any respect, save your bounty next time by posting your own detailed specific question. Then others can ask questions in comments and narrow it down.
