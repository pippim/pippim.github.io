That's a pretty sketchy laptop for Linux. Personally I prefer to use Dell laptops. Yes you pay a little more but I buy them two years after they were top-of-the-line and buy the gaming models.

The first specification that raises an eyebrow with your laptop is this:

- Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Education

Really there should be some sort of vetting process for a retailer to sell MS special licenses like this.

Obviously such a retailer on thin margins is not going to test the laptop for Linux in general and, Ubuntu specifically.
