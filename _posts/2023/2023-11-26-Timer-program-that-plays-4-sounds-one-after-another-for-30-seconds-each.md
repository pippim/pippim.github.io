A few years ago I posted a bash script here in **Ask Ubuntu** that addresses the multiple-timer issue:

- [Set of countdown timers with alarm]({% post_url /2018/2018-05-23-Set-of-countdown-timers-with-alarm %})

However, it allows only one custom sound file used on all the alarms.

Since then I wrote a Javascript version that runs on the Chrome or Firefox browser on any device:

- [Tim-ta (Timed Tasks)](https://www.pippim.com/programs/tim-ta.html)

The advantage of this major rewrite is you can run the timers on your smartphone and bring it to your washroom. It runs on Ubuntu of course but dragging your computer to the sink to brush your teeth is not ideal.

The other advantage of ***Tim-ta*** is you can have unlimited custom sound files uploaded and pick from them for each timer.
