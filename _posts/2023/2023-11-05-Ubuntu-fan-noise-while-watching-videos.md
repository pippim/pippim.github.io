The high CPU load of 90% is misleading. It is really 90% divided by the number of virtual CPU cores. In your case, 12 CPUs, it would be 7.5% CPU load.

You are using Google Chrome for YouTube videos and I found that makes my fans kick in as well. If I use Firefox to watch YouTube videos, then the fans stay off, or at least spin so slow, I can't hear them.
