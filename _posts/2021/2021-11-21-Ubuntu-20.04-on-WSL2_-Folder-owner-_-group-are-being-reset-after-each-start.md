From [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46610256/chmod-wsl-bash-doesnt-work):

> To enable changing file owners & permissions, you need to edit  
> `/etc/wsl.conf` and insert the below config options:  
>   
>    ``` yaml   
>    [automount]   
>    options = "metadata"   
>    ```  
>   
> This may require restarting WSL (such as with `wsl --shutdown`) or the  
> host machine to take effect. This has been possible since 2018.

Also consider new method [announced by Microsoft in 2018](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/chmod-chown-wsl-improvements/). This method goes into even more depth and involves the `mount` command.
