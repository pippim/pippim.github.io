Answer would depend on the laptop. For example ***if*** you had a Dell notebook with SIM card slot:

- [Installing Your Wireless SIM Card and Activating Your Mobile Broadband Service](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-ca/000132397/installing-your-wireless-sim-card-and-activating-your-mobile-broadband-service)

... You could theoretically program it to make a call on startup or resume.

If you don't have a laptop with SIM card connected to broadband service this this article:
