The modern way to disable Tracker is found here:

- [Tracker process taking lot of CPU](Tracker process taking lot of CPU)

Run the following command to disable tracker for the current user:

``` 
systemctl --user mask tracker-store.service tracker-miner-fs.service tracker-miner-rss.service tracker-extract.service tracker-miner-apps.service tracker-writeback.service
tracker reset --hard
sudo reboot
```

Interestingly the question was quite popular in 2013:

- [tracker-store and tracker-miner-fs eating up my CPU on every startup](tracker-store and tracker-miner-fs eating up my CPU on every startup)

The solution to disable it here is now outdated. Just pointing out the more things change the more they stay the same...
