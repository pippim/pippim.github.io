I'll answer all your questions below although typically there should only be one question per question.


----------


1.  Hardware: So I want to completely switch to linux, no dual boot. The only thing I am afraid of is if I will be able to use my current hardware.

Your hardware is fine. However I would keep windows, shrink the partition down and install Ubuntu alongside Windows.


----------


2.    Storage: As I mentioned above, I have two drives on my laptop. A C: and a D:.

Ubuntu supports multiple drives.


----------


3.    "Can I go back?".

Follow the advise in 1. and install Ubuntu alongside Windows. Then it's not a question of "going back" because "you never left".
