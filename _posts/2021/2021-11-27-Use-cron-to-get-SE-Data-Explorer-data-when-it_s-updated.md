According to [this answer from 2012][1], the SE Data Explorer data is updated every Sunday at 3am. If true, is it possible to schedule a cron job to run every Monday and execute [this query][2]? 

When the query finishes it would need to download the results in CSV format somewhere.

More specifically - is there a simple way I can run a query against SEDE directly from the terminal?

### Concerns

I imagine it's a little complicated getting cron authenticated by Stack Exchange Data Explorer. I've never run cron with my own User ID. It always runs as `sudo` either every 15 minutes to execute `updatedb` or via scripts in `/etc/cron.daily`, `/etc/cron.weekly` and `/etc/cron.monthly`. SE always wants authentication when I run a DE query as a "normal" user. I have never used cron for signing into a site, running a query, waiting for results, clicking a "download" button, and logging out. It sounds horribly complicated giving cron an X11 session, a GUI Desktop and a browser.
