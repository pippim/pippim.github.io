From: [Closing lid problem](Closing lid problem)


----------


To make Ubuntu do nothing when laptop lid is closed:
Open the `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` file in a text editor as root, for example

`sudo -H gedit /etc/systemd/logind.conf`

Add a line `HandleLidSwitch=ignore`

Restart the systemd daemon with this command:

`sudo service systemd-logind restart`

If that didn't work set the following

`IgnoreLid=true` in `/etc/UPower/UPower.conf`
