There is a good tutorial: [Google Drive File Upload Using The Terminal](https://medium.com/@ianhutch90/google-drive-file-upload-using-the-terminal-3652ee90a6f6).

To summarize the link:

- If not already installed, install `curl`
- create Google security certificate
- test from command line
- create Python script to automate
