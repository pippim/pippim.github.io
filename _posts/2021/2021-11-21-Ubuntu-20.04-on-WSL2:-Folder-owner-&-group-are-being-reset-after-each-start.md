From [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46610256/chmod-wsl-bash-doesnt-work):

Also consider new method [announced by Microsoft in 2018](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/chmod-chown-wsl-improvements/). This method goes into even more depth and involves the `mount` command.
