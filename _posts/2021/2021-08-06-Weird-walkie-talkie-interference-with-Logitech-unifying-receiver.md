RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) is actually common. For example from [this article](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/walkie-talkie-interference-with-macs-apple-displays/):

> "The walkie-talkies in the article yesterday are Motorola FRS (Family  
> Radio Service) transceivers and operate in the 400Mhz range (around  
> 460mhz). At these frequencies the wiring in computers and TV sets can  
> act as antennas. The higher the frequency the short an antenna has to  
> be to be resonant. Depending on the power level of the transmission  
> this can cause all kinds of problem with frequency dependent devices -  
> such as monitors, mice, keyboards and the like.  
>   
> "The frequencies of the two devices can mix and cause problems by  
> adding to or subtracting from the frequencies the device is expecting.  
> This could cause the screen to distort and could also lead to false  
> mouse movements and clicks and well as false keyboard entries.
