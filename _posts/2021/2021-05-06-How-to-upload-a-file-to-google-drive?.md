There is a good tutorial [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/uploading-files-to-google-drive-directly-from-the-terminal-using-curl-2b89db28bb06).

To summarize the link:

- If not already installed, install `curl`
- create Google security certificate
- test from command line
- create Python script to automate
