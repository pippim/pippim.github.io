I like the term *tree* and indeed in Linux there is a command called `tree` that lists everything in the current directory and all directories below along with their files and sub-directories.

[Here][1] is an example to install and use the `tree` command. An example from the link:

Although screenshots of terminals are normally frowned upon, because copy and paste of pure text is favoured, I think the transgression in this instance will probably be forgiven by most readers.
