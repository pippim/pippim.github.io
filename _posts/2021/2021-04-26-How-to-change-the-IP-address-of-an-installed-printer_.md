From this tutorial: [Assigning an HP Network Printer a Fixed IP Address](https://computerchimp.com/troubleshooting/assigning-an-hp-network-printer-a-fixed-ip-address.html)

## Setting a Static IP Address

Once you know your printer’s IP address, entering it is pretty easy. Here’s what you do:

1.    Run your Web browser.
2.    In the Web browser’s address bar, type the IP address of your printer and press Enter. Assuming you entered the right address, the HP printer control panel should appear.
3.    Click the Networking tab.
4.    Under Connections, click Wired.
