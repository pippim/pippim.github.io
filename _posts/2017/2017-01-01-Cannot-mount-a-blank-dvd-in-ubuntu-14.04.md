I got this message two days ago with Ubuntu 16.04 as well. I had inserted a blank DVD in order to burn the Ubuntu 17.04 live DVD. I never had it before with Ubuntu 14.04 so I think it must have something to do with recent kernel updates on both platforms. Simply ignore the message, close the window and gburn your .ISO file to the DVD.

I can't explain why the message appears only that it is "one of those things" that happens where we "shrug our shoulders" and "move on".
