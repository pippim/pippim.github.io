In MS-DOS and Windows there are also `.` and `..`. Quite simply `.` represents the current directory and `..` represents the parent directory.

MS-DOS was born from CPM operating system when Bill Gates bought rights for $80,000 and licensed to IBM as PC-DOS which turned into MS-DOS which turned into Windows which is predicted to land him a Trillion Dollars in the end.

Linux also uses `.` and `..` as the first file system version was based on IBM PC-AT hardware.

As Serg answered in Linux `.` and `..` don't appear in `ls` command because any file beginning with `.` is a hidden file. You can use the `ll` alias to see these files though.

In both MS-DOS and Linux you can use `cd ..` command to change to the parent directory. In Linux when you want to call a command in the current directory (not in the path) you need to prefix the command with `./`. In MS-DOS however it will automatically look in the current directory for the command before searching the PATH.

Apple Mac and Google Android are based on the Linux operating system but I don't know if their file systems also use `.` and `..`.
