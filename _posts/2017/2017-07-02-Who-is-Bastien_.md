Wow lots of bug reports on "Bastien's Computer" being in peoples' bluetooth settings. It turns out you can talk to Bastien himself in this bug report: [Visible as “Bastien Nocera's Computer”][1].

The common solution is to use:

``` 
rfkill list
```

and search for:

``` 
#: hci0: Bluetooth
```
	        Soft blocked: yes
	        Hard blocked: no

Then use:

``` 
rfkill unblock #
```

Where `#` is a number like `0`, `1`, `3` or `6`.

If this doesn't solve it or, it only lasts for a single session, you can find other tips from Bastien in the link above.
