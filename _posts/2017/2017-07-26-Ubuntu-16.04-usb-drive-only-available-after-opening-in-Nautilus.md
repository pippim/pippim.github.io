# Basic CLI steps `lsblk` -> `/etc/fstab`

The basic steps are to list your block devices:

``` 
$ lsblk -o NAME,TYPE,LABEL,UUID
NAME   TYPE LABEL                    UUID
sda    disk                          
├─sda1 part System Reserved          FAC07A55C07A1859
├─sda2 part KSX_Win7                 2EBA8445BA840B91
├─sda3 part KSX Win 8.1              8C3ADAA93ADA8F96
└─sda4 part                          
sdb    disk                          
├─sdb1 part ST9_Win7                 C2F48A08F489FF43
├─sdb2 part ST9_Linux                bf80a37d-dfad-4df1-b8b1-a67ef2a9ab66
└─sdb3 part                          f7ca38bd-ccf1-4d61-b54b-017b1493d1b4
sdc    disk                          
├─sdc2 part F9m_Win7                 5824BF4E76D68BE2
├─sdc3 part F9m_Linux                d02dc21d-dcb2-478e-9f7d-9a3331931de4
└─sdc4 part                          09606fe6-c131-43fc-9ebc-be05a96e1c1d
sdd    disk                          
├─sdd1 part WHITEBLACK               080F-96E9
└─sdd2 part                          
sr0    rom  Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS amd64 2015-08-05-05-38-20-00
```

Then add the drive you want auto-mounted to `/etc/fstab`:

``` 
$ cat /etc/fstab
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
# / was on /dev/sda3 during installation
UUID=d02dc21d-dcb2-478e-9f7d-9a3331931de4 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1
# swap was on /dev/sda4 during installation
UUID=09606fe6-c131-43fc-9ebc-be05a96e1c1d none            swap    sw              0       0
```

# Basic GUI steps

The easiest way of auto-mounting drives is using `Disks` utility accessed from Dash (first option on launcher):

[![Disks GUI][1]][1]

Click on a drive, click on a partition and then click on the nearly invisible gears icon below it after the "play" and <kbd>+</kbd> icons. Then select `Edit Mount Options...` from the drop-down menu:

[![Disks Generic Flash Drive][2]][2]

Here you can hide the partition in Nautilus, prevent auto-mounting or allow auto-mounting (but it doesn't update `/etc/fstab`). In this example the "Generic Flash Disk" is selected and you can see by default it's not auto-mounted.

# Many answers address auto-mounting

This answer will hopefully serve as a "sign post" to finding other answers with more detailed steps for your particular environment. 

The list is a fraction of thousands of questions because only questions with answers are included. Duplicates are also included if they have good answers. 

Questions about "unmounting" are not included to keep the list shorter. Questions requiring `usbmount`, a third-party program for mounting USBs that was required for a short period of time, are omitted. Questions about mounting network drives through configuration files other than`/etc/fstab` are omitted. Questions with specific problems on a specific platform are omitted.

There are thousands of questions about mounting particularly with `ntfs` (Windows) but hopefully this list will provide a short cut to some.

Please feel free edit this answer to add and subtract to this list as you think appropriate. My eyes are bloodshot from reading so many Q&A's and am unlikely to maintain it.

Creating this list of links took a couple of hours but it won't solve everyone's problems. Some will still have to sort through search lists of thousands of Q&A's. Indeed this list is almost exclusive to ***Ask Ubuntu*** and even more answers are on the broader internet and other Stack Exchange sites.
