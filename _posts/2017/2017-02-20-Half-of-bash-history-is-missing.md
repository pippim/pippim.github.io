The other night I was reading AU Q&A and used a bash command:

``` 
inxi -????
```

Problem is today I don't remember characters comprising ????. I want to put the command and parameters into my documentation spreadsheet. Based on an this answer ([How to recall history in teminal][1]) I used this command:

``` 
$ cat .bash_history | grep inxi
inxi -b
sudo apt install inxi
inxi -b
```

However the command I want isn't there even though the history goes far back. I've used the `inxi` commands many times in the terminal since that old history but none of is showing up.

I've also tried <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>+<kbd>inxi</kbd> without any luck. Because I open multiple terminal windows all the time is history tied to a specific window?

Is there a different way to `grep` bash history file(s)? 

Note that I do not prefix terminal commands with a <kbd>Space Bar</kbd> such that they are supressed from history.
