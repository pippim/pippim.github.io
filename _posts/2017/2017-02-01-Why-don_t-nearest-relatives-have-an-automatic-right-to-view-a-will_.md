A will is a personal document between the author, witnesses, lawyer and beneficiaries of the will.

There are instances where family members have caused someone pain and friends / charities are more loved by the author. Some money hungry relatives even after seeing the will might be inclined to say it is a fake anyway. If there were reasons given in the will why they should be left out their feelings could very well be hurt as well.
