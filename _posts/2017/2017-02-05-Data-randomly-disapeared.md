We you log onto Ubuntu and the resolution mysteriously changes or all your desktop icons are gone, chances are good you logged into a "Guest Session" the simple solution is to log off and log back on using your "normal" account.

In some cases you may need to reboot if your software behaves abnormally like conky did in this AU Question: ([Accidentally logged into Guest account, then normal account &amp; conky broken][1]) where I logged out of "Guest Session" and immediately logged into "normal" account without rebooting.
