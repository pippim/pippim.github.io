In many circumstances it is best to install AMD microcode firmware to address "glitches". In your case it is the third option on the sample screen.

On Intel platforms such as mine it reads:

``` 
Using Processor microcode firmware for Intel CPUs from Intel-microcode (proprietary)
```

To access this screen (whether on AMD or Intel CPU, or whether using Nvidia GPU or Radeon GPU) use:

- Select `System Settings` (the gear icon from the launcher)
- Select `Software and Updates`
- Select `Additional Drivers`
