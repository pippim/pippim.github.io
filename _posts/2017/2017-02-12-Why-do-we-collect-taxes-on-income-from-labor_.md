You should be interested in this tax rate too because often capital gains from selling shares can be as low as 15% whilst personal income taxes can be as high as 50%. Therefore in many situations an executive's pay will be a combination of salary + shares. The justification floated to the average man is it is an incentive for the executive to increase stock value for shareholders. However because of the timing involved (executive buys shares at time prices are low and sells when prices are high) profit is almost always guaranteed.

Not asked in your question is "do we need personal income taxes?". Under a gold based money system--yes you do. Under a FIAT currency system where debt is constantly expanding--no you don't. As long as other governments recognize your currency has value you can keep printing it and paying government employees, purchasing goods and paying citizens welfare, etc.
