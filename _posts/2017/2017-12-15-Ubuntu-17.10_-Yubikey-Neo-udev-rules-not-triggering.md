Your `udev` rule isn't included in your question but from [this forum][1] I copied one and modified it:

``` 
$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/45-yubikey.rules
ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1050", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0116", RUN+="/path/to/screensaver-unlock.sh"
ACTION=="remove", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1050", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0116", RUN+="/path/to/screensaver-locksh"
```

**Note:** Product ID `0010` was changed to `0116` to match your `udev` info.

The scripts on the forum to lock and unlock the screen are not very secure as commentators have pointed out.

Looking at today's comments it reminds me to ensure your script is flagged as executable:

``` 
chmod a+x /path/to/script.sh
```
