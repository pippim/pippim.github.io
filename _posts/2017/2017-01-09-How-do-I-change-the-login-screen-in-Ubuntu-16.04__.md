To change the login screen in Ubuntu 16.04 I used the following:

``` 
gksu gedit /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/10_unity_greeter_background.gschema.override
```

Insert these lines:

``` 
[com.canonical.unity-greeter]
draw-user-backgrounds=false
background='/home/$USER/Pictures/1920x1080-TuxSuckingWindowsTetraWwallpaper.jpg'
# After changing use: sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
```

Where:

 - `$USER` = your user ID.
 - `Pictures` = your wallpaper directory.
 - `1920x1080-TuxSuckingWindowsTetraWwallpaper.jpg` = your image file name (can be `.png` format too).
 - `#` (comment) ... reminds you what to do after changing!

Save the file and exit `gedit`

Now compile the new login wallpaper with:

``` 
sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
```

Last step is to reboot.

Note on my system this no only changes the initial login screen but also the lock screen login as well.

## Point and click with Nautilus to set login screen wallpaper

I wrote a script where you can navigate to a directory / image, right click on it and set it as login screen / lock screen background using Nautilus (file manager now called "Files"): [Nautilus can set desktop wallpaper.
