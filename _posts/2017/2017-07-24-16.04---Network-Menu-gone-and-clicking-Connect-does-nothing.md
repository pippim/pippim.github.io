Although I personally never had this problem, I did a little digging and the closest I could find is [this][1].

## Here is the gist of the solution

The smarter way to save the security key, along with other settings is to do it via Network Manager settings (nm-applet menu > `Edit Connections` > `Wireless` tab > double-click your connection > `Security` tab). That is the frontend to handle those key files.

Assuming something might have broken in Network Manager installation while upgrading, you may try to completely purge it, then re-install it. To download the packages in advance (since you'll lost internet connection as soon as you purge it) -

``` 
sudo apt-get install -d --reinstall network-manager network-manager-gnome
```

Then to purge it -

``` 
sudo apt-get purge network-manager-gnome network-manager
```

To reinstall it (I suggest a reboot in-between) from the downloaded packages, simply -

``` 
sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
```
