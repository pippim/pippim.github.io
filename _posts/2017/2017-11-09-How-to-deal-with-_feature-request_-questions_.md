I'm not sure if I'm strictly adhering to on-topic here but there are many instances when someone asks for a new feature and Serge or someone else (in the rare case myself) will write a solution for them.

This is probably a case of a "new function" or "new program" request though. There are people who can / will take an existing full-fledged application and can modify the code for you / them but I honestly don't know how often this happens as I'm rather Git-Hub-Fork-Challenged so far.

Another thing to consider is there might be another way of accomplishing the end goal without following the "feature request" game plan of the questioner.

I guess my answer is we should be tolerant / open-minded about "feature requests".
