    Is there an officially stated reason why Trump's ban includes Iran and Iraq, but not Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, or Pakistan?

The countries Trump is banning are the ones he has active military actions in: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Islam is in every country in the world. 

The recent America-EU attacks had citizens from Pakistan (San Berndino, CA), France and Tunisia. Countries with Islam, although not as majority.

I think Trump fears retaliations from the banned countries as a consequence for US military incursions into those areas. Islam in itself is not the real reason as real Islamic attacks are not coming from those nations. Blow back because of economic loss, family loss or nationalistic pride could come from the banned countries though.

Much the same as Japanese intern camps in Canada and US during WW II, setting up enemy intern camps (refugee camps in today's language) in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Greece keeps ethnicity of warring nations (even if war wasn't officially declared) at bay.

Hopefully we'll soon discover the names of the deep-state people who economically benefit from waging wars using the naive US military in the banned countries. A time will come when the US military will be co-opted and actions will turned within instead of outside.
