You'll need to get your Windows 8 product key from your BIOS and write it down for future installation. In the terminal type:

``` 
sudo cat /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/MSDM
```

Which will reveal something like this:

``` 
MSDMUoDELL  QA09   LOHR#####-#####-#####-#####-#####%
```

You can read other techniques of accomplishing key extraction [here][1].

The next step of erasing Ubuntu and installing Windows is documented here: [How to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on?][2].
