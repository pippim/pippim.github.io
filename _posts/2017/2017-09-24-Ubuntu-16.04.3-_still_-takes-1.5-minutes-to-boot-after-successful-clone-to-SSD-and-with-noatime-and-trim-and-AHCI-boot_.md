I went through a similar (although not as drastic) [experience][1].

From the terminal you need to use:

``` 
sudo systemctl disable snapd.refresh.service
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service
```

If you aren't using `snapd` disabling it isn't a problem. As per my own experience disabling `NetworkManager-wait-online-service` during boot isn't a problem.

As far as `apt-daily.service` goes it's a [known bug][2]. It wasn't designed to be run during boot but fifteen minutes into your session. There are a couple of different answers to that problem but as I've never encountered it cannot say which is better. (I would go with the one with the most upvotes though).

Although SSD boot took my time from 45 seconds to 11 seconds, I'm sorry you bought one thinking it would solve this particular problem. You'll still enjoy it though because applications will load in a few seconds instead of 15 seconds.
