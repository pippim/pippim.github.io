I think HDMI over a 1.1 USB bus would be waayyyy to slow. Buy a brand new laptop with HDMI for $400 or one a couple years old for $100-$200 used. If you are talking desktop it's even cheaper.

[HDMI 1.0 bandwidth is 5 billion bits per second][1]

[USB 1.1 bandwidth is 12 million bits per second][2]

So even if you could somehow make a physical connection the video you watch wouldn't be 30 frames per second but rather one frame every 416 seconds.
