Although there are similar questions and answers in Ask Ubuntu that dance around the bush none of them cut to the chase (that I've found so far). You need to perform a few steps to get **Rhythmbox** as the default music player:

1. In **Nautilus** file manager navigate to any `.mp3` file.
2. Give the it focus with a single left click. 
3. Hover the mouse over the top screen line (systray)
4. A menu is revealed on the systray from that select `File`
5. At the drop down menu select `Properties`
6. From the Properties window select the `Open With` tab:

Select `Rhythmbox` as the application and click the lower right button `Set as Default`
