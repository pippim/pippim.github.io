As many already know the Unity Desktop Environment (DE) will no longer be actively developed by Canonical (the makers of Ubuntu). Instead they will be shuffling some resources into "tweaking" Gnome DE.

I would like to read up on the progress of Ubuntu developments and wonder what sites can be followed. I've already heard about "OMG Ubuntu" and have read some of their articles.
