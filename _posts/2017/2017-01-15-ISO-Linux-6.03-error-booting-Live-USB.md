After googling many websites with `Dell Inspiron USB Boot Error` I found a link to these instructions ([pendrivelinux.com - BIOS USB booting tips and tricks][1]) which tells us to unplug all other USB devices:

 - Port 1 had extra power cable for charging USB devices next to laptop.
 - Port 2 had USB bootable flash drive that didn't work.
 - Port 3 had Logitech unifying receiver for K800 backlit keyboard and MX Pro mouse
 - Port 5 had 10 foot USB 3 cable to 7 port powered hub containing printer, UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply) communications, cell phone and bluetooth headphone charging.

Unplugging everything except the USB Flash drive made USB boot successful:
