# Programmable Calendars

Although these are GUI calendars you can still call them from the terminal. They allow you to navigate through the months and years. They are designed to be called from your Bash scripts but like all Bash commands you can call them from the terminal too.

## `YAD` (Yet Another Dialog) super-charged fork of `Zenity`

Do not be concerned by the Gtk warning message. You see that a lot when running GUI programs from the terminal. eg. `gedit` and `nautilus` display similar warnings.
