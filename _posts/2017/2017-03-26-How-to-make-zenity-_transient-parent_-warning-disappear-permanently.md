# Automatically add `2>/dev/null` every time zenity is called

Edit the file `~/.bashrc` and search for these lines:

``` 
# some more ls aliases
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias l='ls -CF'
```

Add the following lines after:

``` 
# Add zenity alias to make the annoying terminal error message disappear forever:
# "Gtk-Message: GtkDialog mapped without a transient parent. This is discouraged."
alias zenity="zenity 2>/dev/null"
```

Save the file and open a new terminal window to test:

``` 
zenity --info --text "Hello Zenity-Silly-Error-Free World"
```

Voila! All your old code is fixed and future code doesn't need to have `2>/dev/null` appended to it like all the other answers instruct.
