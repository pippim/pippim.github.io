On gmail.com, I see this:

> 0.38 GB (2%) of 15 GB used  

I have 20 GB of my 30 GB partition filled with Ubuntu stuff, but probably only 1 GB of important documents, so why not use this free cloud storage for backup?

Is there already a program to do this? I'll probably write one anyway but wanted to ask before I start. 

I also want file compression and segmentation, because some systems have 10 MB attachment limits (like the one at work).

Thanks :)
