I used the most basic solution to fix screen tearing with the Intel iGPU (integrated Graphics Processing Unit).

With `sudo` powers edit/create the file `/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf` and copy in the following:

``` 
Section "Device"
   Identifier  "Intel Graphics"
   Driver      "intel"
   Option      "TearFree"    "true"
EndSection
```

Save the file.

After making these changes you'll need to restart xserver either by logging in again or rebooting. The latter is always preferable for me.

**NOTE:** [Arch Linux][1] recommends putting the file in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf` which I've been using for a year. Both locations work.
