# `head` and `tail` solution

Assume the source file is called `~/a` and the file to be inserted is called `~/b`. We'll put the merged file into `~/c`:

``` 
head -n 5 ~/a > ~/c
cat ~/b >> ~/c
tail --lines=+6 ~/a >> ~/c
```

- The path `~/` is short hand for your `/home/user` directory name
- head copies the first five lines of file `a` into newly created file `c`
- cat lists the contents of file `b` and appends it to file `c`
- tail appends file `a` starting at line 6 until the end to file `c`

# After verification rename merged file

After verifying that file `c` is merged correctly from files `a` and `b` we'll rename `c` to `a` using:

``` 
mv ~/c ~/a
```

- `mv` moves file `c` into file `a`. Data isn't physically moved. The file is simply renamed which saves time.
