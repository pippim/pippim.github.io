## When I click `no action needed`...

When someone else has posted a comment and a reply should be forthcoming I click "No action needed" because the unknowable is unknowable as a former Pentagon chief once said.

That said I had to look back 8 pages in Zanna's history link and all the questions / answers were marked **reviewed** and none were marked "no action needed**. Sadly there were only three, two of them are deleted now and I remember voting that way. One is still intact and I think I voted "Looks OK".

So apparently I don't vote "no action needed* very often.

## When I click `skip`...

Is when I know absolutely nothing about the Question or Answer even after googling the key words.

Lets face it anyone who claims to know everything about everything is delusional and there are many things in Hardware, Software, Programming, OS, IT, Systems Administration, Management Information Systems, Data Processing and particularly Statistics I don't know.

## The `Comment` button is your friend...

In between "No action", "Recommend delete" and "Skip" lies your comment button. Click that and seek clarification.

As Eliah points out below if someone has already commented and you agree with it, click the up-vote flag beside the comment and then click "I'm Done" button.
