I have two variables `$sunrise`="7:23 am" and `$sunset`="6:10 pm". I need to convert both of them to today's epoch equivalent as in:

``` 
secSunrise=($date ... "$sunrise" ... +"%s")
secSunset=$(date ... "$sunset" ... +"%s")
```

The only thing I've figured out so far is doing it with current date-time:

``` 
$ secNow=$(date +"%s")
$ echo $secNow
1488331535
```


How to square this circle and plug the `HH:MM am/pm` 12-hour formatted variable into the `date` command?
