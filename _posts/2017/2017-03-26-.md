If I understand your question correctly you want to use:

``` 
echo "hello" > ~/Desktop/new_file.txt && echo "world" >> ~/Desktop/new_file.txt
```

Then to check the results use `cat ~/Desktop/new_file.txt` which shows:

``` 
hello
world
```

There's a shorter way of doing this but I'm kind of new to Linux myself.
