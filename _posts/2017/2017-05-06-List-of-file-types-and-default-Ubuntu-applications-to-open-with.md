I'm writing a humble file manager and am seeking a list of different file types and what default applications Ubuntu uses to open them with.

So far I've only figured out "text" open with `gedit`, "image" open with `eog` (eye-of-gnome) and "audio" open with `ogg123`. I'm not sure if `ogg123` is a default application though.

I'd appreciate a little help expanding the list in the code below:



``` bash
function OpenFileWithMagic () {

local FileType
FileType=$(file -i "$DfName/$2" | grep -oP '(?<=: ).*?(?=/)')
logger "bafman - OpenFileWithMagic - FileType: $FileType DfName: - $DfName parm 1: $1 2: $2 3: $3 4: $4"

case $FileType in

text)
    # TODO: expand list of file types and associated applications to open them with
    if [[ $4 == root ]]; then
        gsu gedit $DfName/$2
    else
        gedit $DfName/$2
    fi ;;
image)
    eog $DfName/$2 ;;
audio)
    ogg123 $DfName/$2 ;;
esac

} ### OpenFileWithMagic ()
export -f OpenFileWithMagic
```

**Notes:** `export` is only required because file is opened when double-clicking from `yad` dialog box. I also need help figuring out "magic" numbers and how one might interpret them. Perhaps an educating link?

**Edit** This is not a duplicate of [How to open file with default application from command line?](How to open file with default application from command line?)e because:

 - That question is how to open a file from the **command line**. This question is how do it from a **bash script** within a `case` structure.
 - The answer there would result in `rhythembox` being used for sound files which is not wanted. `ogg123` is more suited for playing sounds without a new window being opened and closing with python error messages.
 - The answer there would use `xdg-open /bin/mv` resulting in:

``` bash
    gvfs-open: /bin/mv: error opening location: No application is registered as handling this file
```
 - With the above bash script the `file -i /bin/mv` command results in:

``` bash
    /bin/mv: application/x-executable; charset=binary
```


After filtering out processing for all desired file types within the bash script then the left overs could be passed to `xdg-open` which is used in the duplicate candidate.

**Reply to comments** As pointed out by [DK Bose][1] major file types can be found in `/usr/share/mime/types`. Here there are additional types to be considered such as `Video` (a suitable default Ubuntu video player needs to be sourced), `Application` (rather than running it, info about the application needs to be displayed) and `Message` (I have no clue how to display this). Additional mime types needing further research are `inode`, `model`, `multipart` and `x-content`. 

[rinzwind][2] pointed out `ogg123` is not a default sound file player in Ubuntu. A suitable installed-by-default  Ubuntu application to play sound files is `canberra-gtk-play` as answered October 5, 2016 by [wjzndrea][3] in this Q&A: [Can line draw characters (or colors) be added to a Bash file list menu?][4].
