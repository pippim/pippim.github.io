The actual name should be `Screen Display` and not `Display and monitor` as this shows:

[![Screen Display][1]][1]

In the middle of the window uncheck the option that says ***Mirror Displays***.

It has happened to me before where extended displays mysteriously changed to mirrored. However it's been a long time since this has happened and it's only ocurred once or twice since upgrading to **16.04** in August 2016.
