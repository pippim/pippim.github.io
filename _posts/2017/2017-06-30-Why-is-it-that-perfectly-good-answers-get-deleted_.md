To back up your theory you have included a couple of examples as requested in *comments*.


----------


In example 1 your answer did not work for the OP. Additionally the OP's question appears to be a duplicate question of "Hash Sum Mismatch" and I flagged that question as such. Now it's up to the OP to check the duplicate candidate and say "Hey it works" or "No it didn't work and Xxxx happened instead".

Also in your first example you ignored advice in comments from more experienced (in Ask Ubuntu at least) users and got into long arguments. Another point is your answer being too daunting for average Ubuntu users to attempt (in their expert opinion).

In answer example 1 you didn't really "attack Ubuntu" and cannot use that as justification for deletion in your preamble. FYI the `apt-get` functions are written by Debian which Ubuntu is based upon. Ubuntu also repackages code from Gnome, Linux Kernels, Pulse Audio, Xorg and systemd just to name a few.

----------


Generally most complaints about Ubuntu can be traced back to Linux Kernel, drivers, or other third party software. Therefore Ubuntu developers can quickly explain the reason for the bug(s) without feeling much guilt or shame.

Those of us that develop software know how complicated the process is and how easy it is for bugs to creep into the code. The important thing around here is to be nice so if answers are mean, rude, abusive, childish, vulgar, insulting, demeaning, condescending, obnoxious, ridiculing, liable, break copyright laws, or any other laws; they will be deleted.

If you meant "Questions are deleted" that's a different story altogether.
