`$#` is typically used in bash scripts to ensure a parameter is passed. Generally, you check for a parameter at the beginning of your script.

For example, here's a snippet of a script I was working on today:

``` 
if [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then
    echo 'One argument required for the file name, e.g. "Backup-2017-07-25"'
    echo '.tar will automatically be added as a file extension'
    exit 1
fi
```

To summarize `$#` reports the number of parameters passed to a script. In your case, you passed no parameters and the reported result is `0`.

## Other `#` uses in Bash

The `#` is often used in bash to count the number of occurrences or the length of a variable.

To find the length of a string:

``` 
myvar="some string"; echo ${#myvar}
```

returns: `11`

To find the number of array elements:

``` 
myArr=(A B C); echo ${#myArr[@]}
```

returns: `3`

To find the length of the first array element:

``` 
myArr=(A B C); echo ${#myArr[0]}
```

returns: `1` (The length of `A`, 0 is the first element as arrays use zero-based indices/subscripts).
