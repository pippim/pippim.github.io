# NVMe SSD suspend/resume is a know bug

This problem has been reported on [Launchpad][1] and [ArchLinux][2]. The solution is to edit `/etc/default/grub` with `sudo` powers and find the line:

``` 
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet kaslr acpiphp.disable=1 pcie_aspm=off nloglevel=3 udev.log-priority=3"
```

Your options will be different but add the option `acpiphp.disable=1` between the double quotes.

Save the file and run `sudo update-grub`

Reboot and then suspend and resume will work, unless it's a different problem.

# What does `acpiphp.disable=1` do?

According to the [kernel developer][3] in 2013 this disables ACPI hot-plugging. However that doesn't mean hot-plugging is disabled on your machine. For example, replugging the USB cord to your Android phone brings up Nautilus to view files as it should. Also power cycling a second TV connected to your laptop via USB-C ThunderBolt 3 to Displayport to HDMI adapter reorganizes windows across workspaces as it should.
