The US military buys parts from China. As recent as 2014 Obama prevented a law passing that would block purchase of China products: ([thenewamerican.com - Obama Pentagon waived ban on chinese parts in US weapons][1]). You and I have a household budget and buy made in China stuff from Walmart to save money. The Pentagon also has a budget (a little larger at $600B+) and will buy stuff from China too. Somethings may not even be made in America anymore.

I can see Trump trying to change that after someone tells him. For example find out the most popular computer chips bought from China and setup plants in America to manufacture them. Then coerce Canada and other major trading parties to buy American rather than Chinese, possibly with export subsidies.
