Data is stored in 8-bit chunks called bytes. CPU's on the PC platform started out at 16-bit (2 bytes processed at a time). In the 1980's the 32-bit CPU appeared (4 bytes processed at a time). Around 2003 64-bit CPU's (8 bytes processed at a time) began to appear on the PC platform.

To summarize your Data is always stored in 8-bit chunks and it doesn't matter how many bits your CPU can process in a single instruction. Programs must be compiled to match the specific number of bits in the CPU so those will have to change but your Image files will not have to be modified.
