Bonjour. The best write up comes from [Red Hat][1].

The first step in severe problem resolution is rescue mode initiated with:

``` 
~]# systemctl rescue

Broadcast message from root@localhost on pts/0 (Fri 2013-10-25 18:23:15 CEST):

The system is going down to rescue mode NOW!
```

However there are times where `rescue mode` doesn't work and you have to enter `emergency` mode. This mounts foot file system as `read-only`, doesn't mount any other local file systems and doesn't enable network connections. To enter emergency mode use:

``` 
systemctl emergency
```

This is an abbreviated summary so please read the Red Hat link for more detailed `systemd` usage.

All-in-all I think we all hope we never have to use `rescue` target in the first place or `emergency` target second place.
