> Is renouncing his Canadian citizenship the only step he needed to take in order to be a viable candidate for the U.S. presidency?  

From [wikipedia][1]:

> The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) neither defines dual  
> citizenship nor takes a position for it or against it. There has been  
> no prohibition against dual citizenship, but some provisions of the  
> INA and earlier U.S. nationality laws were designed to reduce  
> situations in which dual citizenship exists. Although naturalizing  
> citizens are required to undertake an oath renouncing previous  
> allegiances, the oath has never been enforced to require the actual  
> termination of original citizenship.[31]  

If you don't mind an opinion interjected; I think Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian Citizenship and distanced himself from Calgarian cultural upbringing to lessen political attacks especially from Fox Media types.

If you don't mind an analytical observation; Whether or not his Alberta heritage makes one a good leader or a bad leader of an international super power is a mute point in this question. But remember Albertans have been called "[Blue eyed Arabs][2]" and as noted in redit "[Alberta is so American][3]". But the link I really want I can't find which shows how Alberta was settled by American gun-runners trading native furs for western guns and whiskey before England kicked them out with the NWMP (North Western Mounted Police) who were the predecessors to the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) who are kind of world famous today for their red coats and brown hats. "The RCMP always gets their man" is famous quote.

Sorry for digressing but the point is someone from Alberta (whose heritage is arguably both Saudi Arabian and American in nature) is not necessarily a bad thing coupled with the socialist laws, diversity and harmony of immigrants seeking capitalist gains like you see in Canada. Ted Cruz is the wrong man for other reasons I surmise.
