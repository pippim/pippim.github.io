When you boot Ubuntu it powers off the nVidia GPU. When you reboot power remains off so Windows doesn't see it. The same thing can happen with other devices when you reboot from Windows back to Grub and then Ubuntu.

The solution is to **Shut Down** and then **Power On**.

There is a reason why they call it "warm boot" versus "cold boot" and "soft boot" versus "hard boot". This is just one example.
