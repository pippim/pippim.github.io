## Short Answer:

# NO

## Long Answer:

The last time I looked, religion wasn't on a passport. Therefore the only way you could ban one religion would require the airlines to ask passengers their religion. As such they could easily lie and say "atheist" or "agnostic" to board the plane. Therefore you must ban all passport holders from a given nation(s).

Bonus answer; majority of Americans support the travel ban ([Trump travel ban poll][1]) so much of the media and opportunistic politicians are off-side with the will of the people. If the public has been mislead about the six or seven nations (I forget exact number) in question is a different issue.
