# `cal` calendar command for terminal

You can use the `cal` command to display a calendar in Julian or Gregorian format. The format depends on your locale settings but can be toggled with parameters.

As the screen below shows the default calendar is the current month. You can use the parameter `-A 2` to display the next two months or `2018` to display all months in that year:
