After decades of command line usage I'm getting comfortable using Nautilus (Ubuntu file manager). I'd like to start playing with encryption but do not want to encrypt my whole `/home` directory.

I was thinking of creating a directory of encrypted files and would like to use Nautilus to drag and drop files there.

Can this be done? If so could you outline the steps to accomplish this? Also is it possible to click on an encrypted directory in Nautilus and enter the encryption key to gain access?

Thanks.
