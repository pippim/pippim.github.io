After you install [gnome-gmail][1] or [desktop-webmail][2] for Ubuntu 16.04 you need to set it as the default mail application. Some instructions online say to go to `Applications` - `Internet` but that is for older versions. For Ubuntu 16.04 you need to go to `System Settings` -> `Details` -> `Default Applications` where you will be greeted with this screen:

[![System Settings Details Default Applications][3]][3]

The second option **Mail** will contain these options (after installation steps in the question):

 - Thunderbird
 - Gnome Gmail
 - Desktop Webmail

In the example above `Gnome Gmail` has been selected as the default mail application. Now when you click to send files in LibreOffice gmail will be used instead of Thunderbird configuration popping up.
