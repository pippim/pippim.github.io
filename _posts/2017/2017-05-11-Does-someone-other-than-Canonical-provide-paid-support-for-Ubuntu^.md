Phone support plans can probably be acquired from most consultants and some smaller boutique developers. >$100/hr I imagine.

## Solution proposed in comments

Create a network of Linux systems professionals spanning many disciplines including kernel, distros (Ubuntu, Arch, Red Hat, etc), bash, python, raid, encryption, networking and major applications (LibreOffice, Wine, Imaging, Videos and Audio). Initially this would be hundreds of experts around the world but most would only work ~10 hours per week as they have full time jobs or University studies.

Create database of clients (thousands initially). They would log into website to setup basic information for each computer and printer they use.

Create mirrored Websites hosted in California, New York, Florida, Toronto, London, and Sydney. Clients will sign on when they need help via chat, mail or VOIP. The website links a given client to available experts.

A utility can be run from website to get diagnostics on the machine in question which is visible to expert. Expert does not get direct access to the client machine for security and bond-able reasons. Expert can look at configuration files on client machine but could not, for example, copy off customer list to the expert's machine.

Client's pay $100 minimum per incident and expert receives $50 minimum per incident assuming professional service is provided. Expert is expected to type in notes after incident is solved so the next expert has access to them when client calls again. All chats are logged into history.

The core website software is essentially a help desk with global dimensions. Initially there will only be one global Linux support company but with millions of desktops this will grow to dozens of support companies and settle down to 3 or 4 majors.

The same website software would likely be tailored for other industries.
