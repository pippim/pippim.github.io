I think this [answer][1] sums it up nicely:

# From man bash:

## Invocation

[...]

> When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a  
> non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and  
> executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.  
> After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login,  
> and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from  
> the first one that exists and is readable. The --noprofile option may  
> be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.  

[...]

> When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash  
> reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists. This  
> may be inhibited by using the --norc option. The --rcfile file option  
> will force bash to read and execute commands from file instead of  
> ~/.bashrc.
