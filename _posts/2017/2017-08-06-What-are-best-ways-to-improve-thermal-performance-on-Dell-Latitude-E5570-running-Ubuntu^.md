# Summary of experience with Dell Inspiron 17R 7720 SE

Each laptop model can require different "tweaking" for CPU frequency, Turbo Boost, Hyper-Threading, Fan Speed and battery life. The answers I've written are based on my Dell Laptop. Here are the answers I've written for others with overheating issues:

- [Bash script to sleep at given CPU temperature ~ update for 16.04]({% post_url /2017/2017-01-27-Bash-script-to-sleep-at-given-CPU-temperature-~-update-for-16.04 %})

# Which is the best link?

From the answers I've written I feel [Stop cpu from overheating](Stop cpu from overheating)2 is the best link for you. However I've included all the links because answers written by other users will probably be helpful and some might even be better for your laptop.
