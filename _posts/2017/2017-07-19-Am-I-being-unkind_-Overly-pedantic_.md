Personally I've never read "dual-booting in Wikipedia" but I have read many threads here and in Ubuntu Forums on the subject. So for OP to claim an ultimate holly-than-thou source on the subject is, well, subjective.

We can't get into a competition on the best source of a given problem. Our job is to only point out sources.

As Thomas says there is a "Be Nice" rule and I think we all should appreciate it because we want people to be nice to us too. No one knows everything about everything so even though. Some might have expertise in lets say hardware like RAM, CPU, SSD, etc. but be weak in developing GUI's in BASH. Therefore everyone has the opportunity to point the finger or have a finger pointed at them.

Like Fabby says if you find a particular question annoying it is best to bite your tongue, close it and move on to something else you are more appreciative of.
