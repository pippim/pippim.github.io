I would imagine people teaching English as a Second Language would oppose an immigration ban because it cuts down on their lively-hood. Although a ban on crime is impractical should there be no crime the police would protest.

People who hire immigrants because their labor costs are lower would oppose a ban.

People who are concerned that there are not enough new workers to support aging workers entering retirement would oppose an immigration ban. Over the last four decades there has been a dramatic switch from stay-at-home-moms with high birth rates to working moms with very low birth rates. Immigrants are more likely to have higher birth rates.

People not willing to do certain jobs like cleaning or manual labor would rather go to school or go on welfare and have an immigrant do those jobs. Although these people cannot control immigration they can subconsciously support it. This idea has the least merit and is listed last.
