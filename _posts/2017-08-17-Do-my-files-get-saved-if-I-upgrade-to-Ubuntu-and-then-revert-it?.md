As stated in comments you do not "upgrade" from Windows to Ubuntu. You "switch" from Windows to Ubuntu.

During the installation of Ubuntu you are offered a choice between

 * *erasing* Windows and all other data from the drive to install Ubuntu in their stead or
 * shrinking the partition with the Windows installation to install Ubuntu *alongside* it (this will retain all other previously existing data) or
 * repartitioning the drive(s) and assigning partitions yourself if you have different plans and know what you’re doing, or if the installer can’t figure out how to perform any of the other two options.

When operating in Windows most users create documents with Microsoft Office.

When in Ubuntu most users create documents with LibreOffice (called LO for short). LO has the ability to save files in both Ubuntu format (simplistic term) and Microsoft Office format.

Usually you will operate in "dual boot mode" where both Windows and Ubuntu are installed on your machine and whenever you "reboot" your machine you pick which operating system (Windows or Ubuntu) you want to run.

While operating in Ubuntu you can open and save documents within Windows.

Hope this clears the air for you.
