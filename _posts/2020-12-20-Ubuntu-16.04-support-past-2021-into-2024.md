I'd like to know the exact steps that need to be taken to get Ubuntu 16.04 LTS support past April 2021 through to the year **2024**.

I've read about [Extended Security Maintenance (ESM)][1] and this sounds like a viable option.

Can anyone spell out the exact steps that need to be taken and what costs if any are incurred?
