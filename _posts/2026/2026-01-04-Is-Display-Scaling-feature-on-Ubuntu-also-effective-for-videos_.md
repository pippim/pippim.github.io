***I wonder if this is only effective for scaling desktop graphics or it is also effective for videos***

It won't effect your videos. A video recorded at 1920x1280 will display at 1920x1200 (full screen).

It will effect the size of fonts. For example, when scaling at 125%, a font that used to appear at 10 points will appear at 12.5 points, making it easier to read on a small hi-resolution screen.
