A similar question was asked previously: https://askubuntu.com/questions/774103/selecting-files-from-different-folders

> Is it possible in nautilus to select a bunch of files from a folder,

The accepted answer with 6 up-votes was ***"No, unfortunately it is not possible."***.

Refusing to be dissuaded I wrote a bash script to tackle the problem.

## Bafman Begins

In response to the question I developed `bafman` (Born Again File Manager) which was only somewhat successful because there was little interest in the answer.

There are 13 screens in the answer, so here is one of them to give you the idea:

## Bafman Returns

The bash code was posted in a separate answer below the first but revisions made it too large to fit within the 30K limit so the answer was deleted. If someone is interested in the bash script I'd be happy to resurrect the project and post it in github.
