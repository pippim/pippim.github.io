Your 1610 printer is listed twice in `/etc/cups/printers.conf` with different UUID's each time.

In my configuration file the Brother printer is only listed once:

{% include copyHeader.html %}
``` 
# Printer configuration file for CUPS v2.1.3
# Written by cupsd
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE WHEN CUPSD IS RUNNING
<DefaultPrinter DCP7065DN>
UUID urn:uuidzf3a944e2-df3b-3462-73f0-bf2d45b99cdf
Info DCP7065DN
MakeModel Brother DCP7065DN for CUPS
DeviceURI usb://Brother/DCP-7065DN?serial=U62712M1N423077
State Idle
StateTime 1472268209
ConfigTime 1470519913
Type 8392724
Accepting Ves
Shared Ves
JobSheets none none
QuotaPeriod 0
PageLimit 0
KLimit 0
OpPolicy default
ErrorPolicy retry-job
</DefaultPrinter>

```

I would delete your second printer starting from `<Printer DCP1610W>` down to the last line of the file `</Printer>`.

Before editing `/etc/cups/printers.conf` you need to stop cupsd service with:

``` 
sudo systemctl stop cups

```

Then do your edit. After saving your configuration file restart cupsd service with:

``` 
sudo systemctl start cups

```

One caveat I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 not Xubuntu 16.04.
