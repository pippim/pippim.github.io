The part you are look for is at the bottom from: [Switch to Console in Ubuntu 18.04 - How to Leave GUI?](Switch to Console in Ubuntu 18.04 - How to Leave GUI?)

To make a long story short use: <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>


----------

If the function keys don't work you can try [these instructions][1].

In summary you can type:

``` 
sudo chvt 2
```

to switch to TTY2.

There is a lot more you can do with commands to bypass the function keys. Please read the link.
