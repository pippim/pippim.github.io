Uninstalling (for the most part) is simply reversing the installation method. For example, if to install it you used:

``` 
sudo apt-get install ndisgtk
```

Then to uninstall it you would use:

``` 
sudo apt-get remove ndisgtk
```

There are additional details you might want to read:

- [How do I cleanly remove NDISwrapper?](How do I cleanly remove NDISwrapper?)
- [How do I remove ndiswrapper completely?](How do I remove ndiswrapper completely?)
- [How to Uninstall Ndiswrapper](https://sourceforge.net/p/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper/Uninstall_HowTo/)

The last link deals with the windows wrapped drivers that are created in `/lib/modules/uname -r/misc`, `/etc/ndiswrapper` and `/etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper`.

That said I'm often one of those "Leave well enough alone" guys and even if I wasn't using Windows Wrapped Drivers anymore I might be tempted to just leave them be. On the other hand if `dkms` was compiling the new drivers with each kernel update and the time was distracting me, I probably would purge it all.
