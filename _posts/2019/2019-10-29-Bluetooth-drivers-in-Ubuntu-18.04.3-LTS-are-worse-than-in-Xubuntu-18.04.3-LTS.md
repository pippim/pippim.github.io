There are hundreds of bluetooth posts in **Ask Ubuntu** but we can narrow it down to your needs:

- [How do I get a Bluetooth speaker to auto-connect at login?](How do I get a Bluetooth speaker to auto-connect at login?)

The 18.04 answer here describes how to make the device auto-connect from the command line and then how to incorporate it into an automated script with no human interaction.

For 16.04 users a similar answer exists:

- [Autoconnect to a bluetooth speaker in Ubuntu 16.04](Autoconnect to a bluetooth speaker in Ubuntu 16.04)

If you have problems in 18.04 with blueman automatically disconnecting this might be helpful:

- [Is there any way by which I can stop Bluetooth from turning off by itself?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1040497/bluetooth-problem-ubuntu-18-04-lts)
