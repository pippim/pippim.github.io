It be caused by a new kernel introduced in 19.10 like this case:

- [Lagging after update to 19.10 from 19.04]({% post_url /2019/2019-10-28-Lagging-after-update-to-19.10-from-19.04 %})



If not then you can use this script `/etc/systemd/system-sleep/reloadpulse`:

``` sh
#!/bin/sh

# NAME: reloadpulse
# PATH: /lib/systemd/system-sleep
# CALL: Called from SystemD automatically

# DESC: PulseAudo 8 sets sound to dummy ouput when going to sleep.
#       This script kills and reloads pulse audio.

# DATE: November 25, 2019.

# NOTE: Written for ask ubuntu question:
#       https://askubuntu.com/questions/1191649/why-no-sound-on-wake-dummy-output-takes-over-pulseaudio-k-the-fix

case $1/$2 in
  pre/*)
    echo "$0: Going to $2..."
    ;;
  post/*)
    echo "$0: Waking up from $2..."
    pulseaudio -k
    ;;
esac
```

Mark the script executable with `chmod a+x /etc/systemd/system-sleep/reloadpulse`

After updates deactivate it with `chmod a-x /etc/systemd/system-sleep/reloadpulse`

Then if the update didn't fix the problem make it executable again.

You need to reboot for changes to take effect.
