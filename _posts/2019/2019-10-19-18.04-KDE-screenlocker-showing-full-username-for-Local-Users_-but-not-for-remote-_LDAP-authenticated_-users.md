I've found a similar post with additional details that may benefit you:

- [KDE Plasma lock screen not showing user][1]

An interesting point is during "Log out" the LDAP the user name does show up even though it doesn't on lock screen. You might want to look there for your source code changes.

Another approach would be to find everywhere in Ubuntu the user name appears and stuff that field with the LDAP user name.

Sorry but this is all I could come up with...
