You can have pulse audio stay on the last selected output source no matter what:

``` 
sudo -H gedit /etc/pulse/default.pa
```

Find this line:

``` 
load-module module-switch-on-port-available
```

and change it to:

``` 
# load-module module-switch-on-port-available
```

An additional step is needed as listed in:

- [Sound configuration is lost on restart](Sound configuration is lost on restart)t 

We need to add the line:

``` 
set-sink-port <name|index>  analog-output-headphones
```

The `name` or `index` of the active sink, and available ports can be displayed with `pactl list sinks`. The way I spelled `analog-output-lineout` may be incorrect.

Save the file and exit.

Restart pulse audio with:

``` 
pulseaudio -k
```

In your sound settings select "Line Out" and it will always stay connected even if you physically unplug it.
