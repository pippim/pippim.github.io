You need to prefix the executable with its path. Alternatively you can modify the Linux `PATH` environment variable and append the Windows path (prefixed with `/mnt/c/`).

Even in Linux symbolic links contain the path. Take for example this command:

``` 
$ ls -la /bin | grep ^l
(...SNIP...)
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root      20 Jun 27 09:49 systemd -> /lib/systemd
```

`systemd` is linked to `/lib/systemd/systemd`. So your symbolic link of:

``` 
sudo ln -s -t java.exe java
```

I imagine (because I'm not a link expert) would need to look something like:

``` 
sudo ln -s -t /mnt/c/Windows/Path/To/java.exe java
## ```



## Use `alias` instead of symbolic link

Rather than a symbolic link I would create an alias in my `~/.bashrc` file thusly:

``` 
alias java='/mnt/c/WindowsPathTo/java.exe'
```

Then whenever you type `java` the mumbo-jumbo is typed on your behalf. Any parameters passed are honoured.
