It is possible you've customized Ubuntu 16.04's suspend settings in one of a few places but assuming you haven't you set it `System Settings` -> `Power`:

If this is set correctly chances are your screen saver is kicking in which will also require a login. It can easily be mistaken as suspend operation. Access it through `System Settings` -> `Brightness & Lock`:
