Having to unload and reload the `psmouse` driver when resuming from suspend is a common problem. You can automate the process with a script though:



Create a new file in the  `/lib/systemd/system-sleep/` directory containing:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

case $1/$2 in
  pre/*)
    echo "Going to $2..."
    # Place your pre suspend commands here, or `exit 0` if no pre suspend action required
    modprobe -r psmouse
    ;;
  post/*)
    echo "Waking up from $2..."
    # Place your post suspend (resume) commands here, or `exit 0` if no post suspend action required
    sleep 2
    modprobe psmouse
    ;;
esac
```

Make it executable:

``` bash
sudo chmod a+x /lib/systemd/system-sleep/script-name
```

After the next reboot, the script will be active.

A script like this has worked for many people over the years. Of course your other option would be trying the previous kernel version and if it works sticking with it.

**Notes when your script isn't working:**

- Ensure the systemd [suspend target is enabled](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1313479/correct-way-to-execute-a-script-on-resume-from-suspend).

- From the same accepted answer in the link, you may need to set `PATH` for external commands by inserting the following command into your script. Add any additional directories your commands may be in:
``` bash

  PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin
```

- If it still isn't working, post a new question. Then drop a comment below with a link to the new question and I'll have a look.
