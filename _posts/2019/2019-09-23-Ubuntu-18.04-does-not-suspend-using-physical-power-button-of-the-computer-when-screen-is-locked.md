I found a superuser answer that applies to your situation:

- [How to suspend from lockscreen in Gnome 3?][1]

Someone pointed me to the file `/etc/systemd/logind.conf`. I was able to set parms that allowed the suspend key to work in any situation regardless what the system requests. Here is an example of my settings.
<blockquote>
[Login]<br/>
# NAutoVTs=6<br/>
# ReserveVT=6<br/>
# KillUserProcesses=no<br/>
# KillOnlyUsers=<br/>
# KillExcludeUsers=root<br/>
# InhibitDelayMaxSec=5<br/>
# HandlePowerKey=poweroff<br/>
<b>HandleSuspendKey=suspend</b><br/>
# HandleHibernateKey=hibernate<br/>
<b>HandleLidSwitch=lock</b><br/>
# PowerKeyIgnoreInhibited=no<br/>
<b>SuspendKeyIgnoreInhibited=yes</b><br/>
# HibernateKeyIgnoreInhibited=no<br/>
<b>LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=yes</b><br/>
# IdleAction=ignore<br/>
# IdleActionSec=30min<br/>
</blockquote>
For some reason a restart was not applying the changes, so I had to run the following command:

``` 
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind

```
