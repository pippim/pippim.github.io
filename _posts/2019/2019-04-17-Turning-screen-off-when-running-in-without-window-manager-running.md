I would simply close the laptop lid to keep dust off the keyboard and power off the screen. 

As no desktop manager is running you need to edit `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` and change this line:

``` 
#HandleLidSwitch=suspend
```

to this:

``` 
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
```

Save the file and use `systemctl restart systemd-logind`
