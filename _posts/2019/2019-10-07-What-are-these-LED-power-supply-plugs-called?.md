New LED lamps made in China have fancy new connectors and I'm searching for the IEEE official name (or whichever authority names them). I need to order male and female ends that can be opened to expose wiring screws inside or soldering posts.

According to Power Brick it's probably 20V DC. The wire looks like 24 gauge? Let's call them think speaker wires. I think the lamp is about 7 watts?

Here's what the male plug looks like next to a dime:

Here's what the female receiver looks like next to a standard USB plug:

My goal is to buy 100 feet of speaker wire and make a 35 foot extension cable and a 25 foot extension.

A nice thin wire pair will run across the living room baseboards nicer than 14 gauge 120VAC cable.
