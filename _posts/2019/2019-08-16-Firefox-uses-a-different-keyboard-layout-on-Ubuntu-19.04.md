Terminal and Gedit are Gnome products but FireFox is not. You could try the Unity Desktop:

- [How to Switch from GNOME to Unity in Ubuntu 18.04 and 17.10][1]

Although written for 17.10 and 18.04 the same installation techniques apply with 19.04.

For a different set of screenshots with Ubuntu 19.04 installation of Unity see:

- [Unity Desktop on Ubuntu 19.04][2]

The only other thing I can think of trying is a different version of Firefox but I'm not sure how successful this would be:

- [How to install previous Firefox version?](How to install previous Firefox version?)
