Probably related to this bug reported by Linux Mint user and confirmed by Ubuntu 18.04 users:

- [Blank Icon in Linux Mint 19][1]

The accepted solution there:

>   
> First, I edited `/usr/share/applications/tusk.desktop` and changed the  
> `Icon=` line back to simply `Icon=tusk` Then, I ran:  
>   
>     sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor/  
> I wanted to see if

> But, it seems that the icon in the `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/0x0/apps`  
> folder is ignored by `gtk-update-icon-cahce` because after updating  
> the cache there was still no icon in the Mint start menu or taskbar  
> when (when Tusk is running). Curiously, the Tusk icon in the "system  
> tray" part of the Mint taskbar works.

> So, leaving `Icon=tusk` in the `.desktop` file, I installed imagemagick

> -    `sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor/`

> After using those commands to make a 512x512 version of the icon in
