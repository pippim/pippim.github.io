A similar question was asked before:

- [Why unattended-upgrades upgraded so few packages, seemingly?][1]

The accept answer states:

> Most of the answer is in your unattended-upgrades logfile, located at  
> `/var/log/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrades.log`  
>   
> Here's an example:  
>   
>     2018-01-08 06:17:51,770 INFO Starting unattended upgrades script  
>     2018-01-08 06:17:51,771 INFO Allowed origins are: ['o=Ubuntu,a=xenial-security']  
>     2018-01-08 06:18:07,765 INFO No packages found that can be upgraded unattended and no pending auto-removals  
>   
> Take a look at that middle line 'Allowed origins'. That means Software  
> Repositories. The only source there is -security. Not -upgrades, not  
> -backports, no PPAs, no third-party repos.  
>   
> In other words, this example unattended-upgrades is **only** providing  
> security upgrades. Nothing else.  
>   
> You can add, remove, or edit Allowed Origins (repositories) through  
> the Software and Updates Control Panel, or by editing the  
> unattended-upgrades config file, located at  
> `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`.  
>   
> The rest of the answer is that Xenial (16.04) is two years old. Fewer  
> new security updates for old software.
