I can't say to be an expert. I run into difficulties in Nautilus just moving a picture from one directory to another. I've found opening a separate instance of Nautilus helps me out.

From the first window of Nautilus select copy. In the second instance of Nautilus select paste. Alternatively to move, just click the icon in the source Nautilus Window and drag it to the target Nautilus window.

Note there are problems reported in Nautilus DnD (Drag and Drop) for Ubuntu 19.04. For that version see:

- [Drag-and-drop functionality no longer working after upgrade to 19.04](Drag-and-drop functionality no longer working after upgrade to 19.04)
