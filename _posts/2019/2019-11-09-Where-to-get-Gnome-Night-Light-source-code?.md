I had thought of asking this question on Stackoverflow but there all the "Night Light" references are for Windows 10 Night Light. Too bad Microsoft and Gnome Developers didn't draw straws for who would call their application "Blueshift" or whatever.

Preamble aside... How do I get source code for Night Light (Gnome version)? Would source code for Mutter and dconf / gsettings also be needed?

I understand there are different versions 3.34.1, 3.35.1 and 3.36 beta:
