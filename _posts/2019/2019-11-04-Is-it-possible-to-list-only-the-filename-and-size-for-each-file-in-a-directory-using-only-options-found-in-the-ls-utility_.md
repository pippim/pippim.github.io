It's impossible to do with the `ls` command by itself. You can do it by piping `ls -l` output to other commands or with a totally different command like `find` as others have answered.

The `tree` command gives another alternative:

``` 
rick@alien:~/askubuntu$ tree -h
.
├── [8.8K]  aptfielout
├── [1.8K]  aptfilein
├── [ 435]  aptfileout
   (... SNIP ...)
├── [  38]  script
├── [4.0K]  subdir-A
│   ├── [  14]  1.mp4
│   ├── [  14]  2.mp4
│   ├── [  14]  3.mp4
│   └── [4.0K]  JSON
│       └── [4.0K]  JSON
│           ├── [   7]  1.json
│           ├── [   7]  2.json
│           ├── [   7]  3.json
│           └── [   7]  4.json
   (... SNIP ...)
├── [1.5K]  ttlus
└── [1.3K]  ttlus~

7 directories, 57 files
```

The `tree` option passed is `-h` for human readable size. For size in exact bytes pass `-s`.
