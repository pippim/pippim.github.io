To get to a command prompt simultaeously press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> keys.

Then type `free -h` and tell us how much RAM you have. For example my system shows 8 GB:

``` 
$ free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           7.7G        5.3G        445M        545M        1.9G        1.4G
Swap:          7.9G        412M        7.5G
```

Copy your four of lines to the clipboard (highlight with mouse and press Ctrl+C). Then edit your question and post the four lines from clipboard (press Ctrl+V) into your question.
