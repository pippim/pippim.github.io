The simplest way, when you aren't booting with EFI, is to move `/boot` to `/` where you have tons of free space.

From: [Arch Linux How to move /boot to /][1]

Rather than removing `/boot` entry though I would comment it out with `#`.

Rather than `chroot` and reinstall GRUB, I would use [boot-repair][2].

If you do not have physical access to your server, [have a look here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1160618/how-do-i-resize-partitions-when-i-dont-have-physical-access-to-a-remote-server)
