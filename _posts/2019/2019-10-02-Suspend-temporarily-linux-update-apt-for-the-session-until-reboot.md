You can run a command based on this answer:

- [How to disable `apt-daily.service` on Ubuntu cloud VM image?][1]

Create a script:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

systemctl stop apt-daily.service
systemctl kill --kill-who=all apt-daily.service

# wait until `apt-get updated` has been killed
while ! (systemctl list-units --all apt-daily.service | egrep -q '(dead|failed)')
do
  sleep 1;
done

# now proceed
echo Apt Daily Service has been killed
```

Mark the script as executable in order to call the command:

``` 
sudo chmod /path/to/my_script.sh
```

You need sudo powers to call the command:

``` 
sudo /path/to/my_script.sh
```

When you are away from the hotspot and back to your regular network reboot to reinstate apt services or type:

``` 
sudo systemctl start apt-daily.service
```

Of course you can forgo the fancy script altogether and stop services with:

``` 
sudo systemctl stop apt-daily.service
```
