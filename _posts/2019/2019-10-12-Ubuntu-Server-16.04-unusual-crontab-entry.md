As stated in comments you have a virus installed by crypto miner. This tells you how to remove it: [Watchbog Vulnerability][1]

``` 
crontab â€“r
ls /var/spool/cron/crontabs
pip uninstall urllib2
apt-get remove --auto-remove curl
apt-get remove --auto-remove wget
crontab -r
while true ; do killall watchbog ; done
sudo passwd root

```
