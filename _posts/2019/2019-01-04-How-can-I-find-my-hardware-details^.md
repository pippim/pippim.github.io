`neofetch` has already been mentioned but there is also `screenfetch` which provides even more information when you open your terminal after you put the command in your `~/.bashrc` file:

[![Terminal Splash Screen][3]][3]

My terminal splash screen contains four components:

- Weather
- Calendar
- Time (when terminal was opened)
- `screenfetch` the system information utility

You can find details for doing this yourself in this answer:
