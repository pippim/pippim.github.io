Your best bet is to ask HP to release an application similar to Windows for Linux. This is a good place to start:

- [HP Developers - HP Linux printing and scanning][1]

In this **Ask Ubuntu** [question][3] it is asked:

- What should one install to make Ubuntu fully support the HP printer and/or scanner?

The answer there is to use:

``` 
sudo apt-get install hplip hplip-gui

```

*However the full answer is **more complicated** than just the simple command*

----------

If you can't get help direct from HP you can try using `wine` to run the Windows application inside Linux:
