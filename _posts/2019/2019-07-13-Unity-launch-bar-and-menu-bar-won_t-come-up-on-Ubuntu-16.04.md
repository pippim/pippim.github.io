There's been a few posts lately of launcher disappearing. Most likely everyone suffered from the same update which introduced a bug. When you boot your computer choose from the grub menu "Advanced options for Ubuntu". From the submenu select the next oldest kernel version that works.

Other than that check these Q&As:

- [Unity doesn&#39;t load, no Launcher, no Dash appears](Unity doesn&#39;t load, no Launcher, no Dash appears)
- [Ubuntu 16.04 - Unity doesn&#39;t load - no Launcher or Dash appears](Ubuntu 16.04 - Unity doesn&#39;t load - no Launcher or Dash appears)
- [No launcher and menu bar on ubuntu 16.04](No launcher and menu bar on ubuntu 16.04)
- [Ubuntu Menu and Launcher not showing after 2/16/2018 update](Ubuntu Menu and Launcher not showing after 2/16/2018 update)

After answer was accepted a comment was made how system worked in recovery mode. If that's the case try the solution in this answer:

- [Ubuntu Menu and Launcher not showing after 2/16/2018 update](Ubuntu Menu and Launcher not showing after 2/16/2018 update)

Open a terminal and use:

``` 
rm -rf ~/.config/compiz-1/compizconfig/*
sudo reboot
```

When rebooting select the most recent kernel rather than the older recovery option.
