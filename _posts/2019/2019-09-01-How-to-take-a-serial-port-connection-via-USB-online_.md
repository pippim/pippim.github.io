Some good reading is available from [Official Ubuntu Documentation][1]:

## Alternative serial client: screen

GNU screen actually is a very capable serial terminal.

To install:

``` 
sudo apt-get install screen
```

To start:

``` 
sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 n
```

**Some additional tips:**  
1. adjust the `n` to what you need:

* Start without a number on the first try; it might auto-negotiate flawlessly
* then use 115200, 57600, 38400, 19200, 9600, 4800,  2400, 1200 and stop when it starts working.
* If you're [a purist](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/51555021#51555021) and don't like using `sudo` for this or need to hand this out to users not having access to `sudo`, add them to the `dialout` group.

To end the session, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>A</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>K</kbd>.
