The main problem is the script has the wrong name of `prargs.sh` when the filename should be `prargs`. The second problem is there should be a "shebang" at the top telling the system it is a bash script:



``` bash
#!/bin/bash

while [ "$#" -ne 0 ]  
do
    ((Count++))
    echo "$Count: $1"  
    shift
done
```

**Note:** Your script was missing the `1: `, `2: `, etc. parameter count. I've added that missing pieces with:

``` bash
((Count++))
echo "$Count: $1"
```

So when you run the script you now see:

``` bash
$ prargs a 'b c' d
1: a
2: b c
3: d
```

The next problem is calling the `prargs` without specifying a location in front. If you place your script in one of your paths it will be found without specifying a directory. To see your current paths use: `echo $PATH`. Many people will create a path in their home directory for personal scripts:

``` bash
mkdir -p $HOME/bin
```

After this reopen the terminal to have it in your path. So create your script as `$HOME/bin/prargs` and then mark it executable:

``` bash
chmod a+x $HOME/bin/prargs
```

After this no matter what your current directory is you can type `prargs a 'b c' d`.
