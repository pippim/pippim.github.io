As suggested in comments, converting `.jpg` to a `.png` file fixed the issue.

`.png` is a more native file format for Linux and `.jpg` is a more native file format for Windows. That said the file conversion software may have removed "noise" from the `.jpg` file when converting it to `.png` format. If there was "noise" what it was is anyone's guess. If you are in a similar situation and you must have `.jpg` file format you can still convert it to another `.jpg` file with a bit of file compression and may also be successful.
