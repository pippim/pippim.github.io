This works on my machine:

``` 
$ string="$(iwconfig wlp60s0 | grep -I Signal)"
$ echo $string
Link Quality=68/70 Signal level=-42 dBm
$ echo $string | cut -d' ' -f4,5
level=-42 dBm
```

- For your machine replace `wlp60s0` with `wlan0`.
- **Note** this is using Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 19.04 where there is a space between `42` and `dBm`. As such the `cut` command is instructed to print fields #4 and #5. In your question there is no space so I'm not sure what version you are using.

You could also use:

``` 
$ echo $string | cut -d'=' -f3
-42 dBm
```

- In this case `cut` is told to use `=` as field delimiter.

If you want to use `${string...}` though the correct syntax is:

``` 
$ echo ${string##*=}
-38 dBm

$ echo "${string##*=}"
-38 dBm  
```

Either method will work to take the substring after the last `=`. The original method of `5` in your question I don't understand how it can work.
