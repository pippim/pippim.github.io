The title of the bug report is:

- ### [v2,4/5] i2c: designware-baytrail: Force the CPU to C1 state while holding the punit semaphore 

The workaroud leads us to this infamous thread in Linux-Land / Ubuntu-Utopia:

- [System freezes completely with Intel Bay Trail](System freezes completely with Intel Bay Trail)

Your best bet is to update grub command line (`sudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub`) with:

``` 
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash intel_idle.max_cstate=1"
```

and then run:

``` 
sudo update-grub
```
