Because 14.04 is EOL (End of Life) there are [special considerations][1]:

That said if you were to do a clean install you might want to do it on a new partition and keep your old partition intact. This is helpful for migrating settings set many years ago on the old partition but unknown for the new partition. For example you may have custom scripts in `/usr/local/bin` or custom settings in `/etc` which you setup many years ago and then forgot about until the new installation isn't working properly.

If you want to upgrade you should consider [cloning your old partition][2] to the new partition and run the upgrade on the clone. Then if the upgrade fails, you can reclone, fix the error condition and run the upgrade again.

Please note an upgrade can take 40 minutes (in my case) to a few hours (reported by other users) depending on your system.

A few times a day, a few times a week, month and year I will change different system settings. Over the course of five years I forget all that I've changed. The advantage of upgrading is none get lost. The disadvantage of reinstalling is all get lost.
