This old Q&A: [How to restart GNOME Shell from command line?](How to restart GNOME Shell from command line?)6 may have the answers for you.

Initially these used to work for people:

- The easiest way is to <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> and type `r` then <kbd>↵</kbd>.
- The command to replace the gnome-shell would be `gnome-shell --replace`.

Now days this seems to be the only solution:

- You can also do a `killall -3 gnome-shell`.

**Note:** This Q&A focuses on restarting gnome display manager **without** loosing all work and going back to Login screen.
