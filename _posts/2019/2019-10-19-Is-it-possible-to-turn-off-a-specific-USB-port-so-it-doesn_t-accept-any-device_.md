Here is a [plug & play][1] (literally) option:

It's a good idea if you want to avoid pop-up messages and file browsers every time you plug your phone in for charging only.

This is also more fool-proof than the software approach because software that turns off the port for data can be reversed by software that turns it back on. Or it might be reinitialized during suspend/resume or some other process you didn't foresee.
