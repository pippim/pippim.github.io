You can install 5.3 at any time on any Ubuntu distribution but that is only recommended when you have new hardware not supported by installed kernels. You can also subscribe to [HWE][1] and eventually get 5.3 or even higher.

To install manually you can select from `5.3.1` through `5.3.5` kernels released by Ubuntu:
