There is an unsolved problem of another MX150 laptop that takes [10 minutes to boot][1] in Windows.

There is a bug report filed against the **ASUS Zenbook** here:

- [intel-microcode on ASUS makes kernel stuck during loading initramfs on bionic-updates, bionic-security][2]

Comment #47 seems to have the solution:

> For anyone having a similar problem, try booting with microcode  
> updates off: add `dis_ucode_ldr` to the kernel command line (from GRUB  
> if you cannot boot)  

To do this use:

``` 
sudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub
```

Find the line containing `quiet splash` and make it read `quiet splash dis_ucode_ldr` whilst keeping everything else on the line the same.

Save the file and type:

``` 
sudo update-grub
reboot
```

Hopefully it all works fine now. If this is your situation make sure to subscribe to the bug report.
