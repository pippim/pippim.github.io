Seth has helped me a great deal over the years. It's sad an issue SE has brought upon themselves is drowning so many great contributors to the sites.

With any luck a SE will have a change of heart and recognize human rights. Then develop a new way of dealing with people whose careers or way of life are being decimated. After SE internal changes are made hopefully then the mods will be rehired / reunited into the fold.

Each mod can take many years to develop but an SE employee is probably for the most part a simple hiring process.

You will both be missed and remembered for all your assistance Seth.
