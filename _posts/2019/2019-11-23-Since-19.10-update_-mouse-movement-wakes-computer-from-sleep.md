## Power off USB devices when suspending



My suspend/resume broke about a year ago. The solution for me was powering off the USB devices before going to sleep and powering them on with resume.

In the directory `/lib/systemd/system-sleep` create this script:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

# Original script was using /bin/sh but shellcheck reporting warnings.

# NAME: custom-xhci_hcd
# PATH: /lib/systemd/system-sleep
# CALL: Called from SystemD automatically
# DESC: Suspend broken for USB3.0 as of Oct 25/2018 various kernels all at once

# DATE: Oct 28 2018.

# NOTE: From comment #61 at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/522998

TMPLIST=/tmp/xhci-dev-list

# Original script was: case "${1}" in hibernate|suspend)

case $1/$2 in
  pre/*)
    echo "$0: Going to $2..."
    echo -n '' > $TMPLIST
          for i in `ls /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/ | egrep '[0-9a-z]+\:[0-9a-z]+\:.*$'`; do
              # Unbind xhci_hcd for first device XXXX:XX:XX.X:
               echo -n "$i" | tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/unbind
           echo "$i" >> $TMPLIST
          done
        ;;
  post/*)
    echo "$0: Waking up from $2..."
    for i in `cat $TMPLIST`; do
              # Bind xhci_hcd for first device XXXX:XX:XX.X:
              echo -n "$i" | tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/bind
    done
    rm $TMPLIST
        ;;
esac
```

Mark the script executable with `chmod a+x /lib/systemd/system-sleep/custom-xhci_hcd`

Reboot.

Confirm script is working with `journalctl -b-0 | grep custom-xhci_hcd`:

``` bash

Nov 12 17:22:19 alien systemd-sleep[20174]: /lib/systemd/system-sleep/custom-xhci_hcd: Waking up from suspend...
  (... SNIP ...)
Nov 22 22:28:06 alien systemd-sleep[24432]: /lib/systemd/system-sleep/custom-xhci_hcd: Going to suspend...
Nov 23 08:16:15 alien systemd-sleep[24432]: /lib/systemd/system-sleep/custom-xhci_hcd: Waking up from suspend...
```
