This is a bug reported here three days ago:

- [Audio / Sound reverts to HDMI when power event occurs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/1850887)

> PulseAudio reverts the sound to HDMI all the time when a HDMI related  
> power event occurs. That means, although I have set another USB sound  
> device plugged in and set as default under sound settings, when an  
> application like Kodi or the system shuts off the HDMI monitor and I  
> reactivate the monitor, the sound is set to HDMI output again and  
> again.  
>   
> That probably has to do with the fix to the reported Bug # 1711101 and  
> definitely not happened at Ubuntu 19.04. I switched to Ubuntu 19.10  
> two days ago.  
>   
> Setting the USB device as default does not help, even when done by  
> PulseAudio mixer (gui) and removing HDMI output from the alternatives  
> option.
