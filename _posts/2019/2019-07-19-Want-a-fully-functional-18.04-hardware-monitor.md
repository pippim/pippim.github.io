I like to use `conky`:

``` 
 sudo apt install conky

```

Conky is a light weight system monitor that let's you pick and choose system information and your own information and place it on the same window you can move anywhere:

My design is about four years out-of-date and not nearly as fancy as "modern" `conky` scripts.

## Ubuntu 18.04

It's come to my attention some people (or everyone?) is having problems with conky under version 18.04. In which case I found this blog:

- [How to install Conky and Conky Manager](https://www.fosslicious.com/2018/05/how-to-install-conky-and-conky-manager.html)

I had upgraded my 16.04 to 18.04 last year and don't recall any problems with conky. That said I rarely use 18.04 and prefer the stability and comfort of 16.04.6 LTS.
