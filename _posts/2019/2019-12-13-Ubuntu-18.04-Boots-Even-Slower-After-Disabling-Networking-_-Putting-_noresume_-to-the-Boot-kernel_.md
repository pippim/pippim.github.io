You can probably disable network waiting altogether:

- [What does NetworkManager-wait-online.service do?]({% post_url /2018/2018-03-23-What-does-NetworkManager-wait-online.service-do_ %})

Remove the journal flush service and vacuum it instead:

- [What is the use of systemd-journal-flush.service?](What is the use of systemd-journal-flush.service?)
- [Systemd logs (`journalctl`) are too large and slow]({% post_url /2018/2018-03-08-Systemd-logs-__journalctl__-are-too-large-and-slow %})

Slow `snapd` times can be sped up by jiggling your mouse at boot time:

- [Long boot delay on Ubuntu loading/splash screen following regular dist-upgrade on clean SSD install (18.04)](Long boot delay on Ubuntu loading/splash screen following regular dist-upgrade on clean SSD install (18.04))
