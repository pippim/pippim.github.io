Part of the problem might be because you are using a "new lab computer" and who knows what they've cooked up in the lab?

Try this for starters:

``` 
$ apt list | grep gnome-terminal

WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with caution in scripts.

gnome-terminal/xenial,now 3.18.3-1ubuntu1 amd64 [installed]
gnome-terminal-data/xenial,xenial,now 3.18.3-1ubuntu1 all [installed]
```

If it doesn't say "`[installed]`" at the end of the last two lines then let's install it with:

``` 
sudo apt install gnome-terminal
```

Hopefully the problem is as simple to fix as that...

Reply to comment:

Sounds like you need to use:

``` 
sudo rm /usr/bin/python3
sudo ln -s python3.5 /usr/bin/python3
```
