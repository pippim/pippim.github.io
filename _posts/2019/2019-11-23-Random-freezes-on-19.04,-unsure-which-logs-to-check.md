## Enable systemd multi-boot message logs

The best solution is to enable [multi-boot message logging][1] and then displaying the last messages of the previous boot:

{% include copyHeader.html %}
``` 
$ journalctl -xe -b-1

In your case the messages won't show a normal shutdown but rather the last recorded messages just before the system crashed.

## Analyzing the messages you found so far

The first error message is addressed here:

- [New alert keeps showing up: Server returned error NXDOMAIN, mitigating potential DNS violation DVE-2018-0001](New alert keeps showing up: Server returned error NXDOMAIN, mitigating potential DNS violation DVE-2018-0001)

The solution is to use:

> It seems that my system had the old config in the place, resulting in  
> a conflict between two services: `resolvconf` and `systemd-resolved`.  
>   
> The symlink `/etc/resolv.con`f pointed to  
> `../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf`  
>   
> Changing it to point to `/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf` which is  
> managed by systemd, fixed it for me.  

The second error message is generated by nvidia:

- [PRIME offloading: Unable to run chrome][2]

The answers posted are only helpful for the software developer, not the end user. For end users running chrome other solutions exist:
