I'm trying to suppress `GtkDialog` warnings in `zenity` and `yad`:

``` bash
$ zenity --error --text hello
Gtk-Message: GtkDialog mapped without a transient parent. This is discouraged.
```

Error redirection and filtering works:

``` bash
$ zenity --error --text hello 2> >(grep -v GtkDialog >&2)
```

**YEAH...** Annoying warning message disappears!!

This can be placed in `~/.bashrc` for development work as answered here:

- [How to make zenity “transient parent” warning disappear permanently (using function)][1]

and here:

- [How to make zenity “transient parent” warning disappear permanently (using alias)][2]

When creating a script for others to use though, you don't want the burden of them changing their `~/.bashrc`.

I'm having trouble creating a typing shortcut for: `2> >(grep -v GtkDialog >&2)` to be used inside script.

For many reasons variable assignment `GTK_SPAM="2> >(grep -v GtkDialog >&2)"` followed later by variable usage `"$GTK_SPAM"` doesn't work.

`alias zenity="zenity 2> >(grep -v GtkDialog >&2)"` before calling script works  but, I can't use this within a script. 

Using an array to hold the typing shortcut isn't working:

``` bash
$ aGtkSpam=(2\> \>\(grep -v GtkDialog \>\&2\))

$ DumpArray "${aGtkSpam[@]}"
Array Elements:
0: 2>
1: >(grep
2: -v
3: GtkDialog
4: >&2)

$ zenity --error --text hello "${aGtkSpam[@]}"
This option is not available. Please see --help for all possible usages.

$ yad --text hello 2> >(grep -v GtkDialog >&2)

$ yad --text hello "${aGtkSpam[@]}"
Gtk-Message: GtkDialog mapped without a transient parent. This is discouraged.
```

I found many excellent generic answers on word-splitting and parameters which ***should*** solve my problem but a specific syntax eludes me.

***Any clues?***
