The article might be a little misleading.

Version **18.10** is supported for 9 months.

It says **18.04** is supported for three more years because it is LTS. This includes 18.04.1, 18.04.2 and 18.04.3 when it comes out, etc. They would all be good until April of year 2021 according to comments below.

It says the advantage of **18.04.2** over **18.04.1** is some of the kernel and driver enhancements in **18.10** have been back-ported to **18.04.2**. In reality I'm on 16.04 and can install kernels and drivers newer than **18.10** as can anyone.
