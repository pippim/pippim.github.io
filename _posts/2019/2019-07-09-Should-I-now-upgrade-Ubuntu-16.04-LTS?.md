You can still get hardware upgrades on 16.04 by installing a newer kernel:

- https://askubuntu.com/questions/119080/how-to-update-kernel-to-the-latest-mainline-version-without-any-distro-upgrade/885165#885165

You would do this for example if you bought a new device to add onto your computer and the drivers for it were only on a newer kernel.

In fact since I've started using Ubuntu 14.04 and then 16.04 I've usually been running on a newer kernel than the distribution version offered. Partly to stay up-to-date but but mostly as a hobby of researching new kernel versions.
