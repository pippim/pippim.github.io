I wrote the [iconic script][1] to give control over which monitor icons are placed on. It also insures icons don't get placed into the "black hole" that exists when monitors of different resolutions are used.

Here are a few screenshots of `iconic` to give you an idea of how it works.


### iconic Monitors Notebook General Tab screenshot

On this notebook tab you can also specify the number of seconds a test will last. Press the <kbd>Test</kbd> button to place icons on the Desktop using currently defined settings for number or columns, rows and reserved screen space.

### iconic Monitors Notebook Monitor 3 tab

Assign a user friendly name to each monitor. Set the number of rows and columnss to utilize for icon placement on each monitor.

Use the <kbd>Test</kbd> button to view what icon placement after number or columns or rows are changed.
