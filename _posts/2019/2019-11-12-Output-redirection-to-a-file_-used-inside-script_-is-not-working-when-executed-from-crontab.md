`logs/testpad1.log` will behave differently depending on your current directory. It can also behave differently depending if `cron` is running as root or you are calling the script from your terminal.

The safe (and usually error correcting) thing to do is hard code the full path into the file name:

``` 
/home/me/scripts/logs/testpad1.log
/var/log/testpad1.log
```
