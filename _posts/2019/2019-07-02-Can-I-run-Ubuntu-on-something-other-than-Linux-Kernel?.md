You have to have an Operating System. Because this site is called **Ask Ubuntu** your question must be reinterpreted to fit into the rules:

- What operating systems (kernels) other than Linux Kernel will Ubuntu run on?

One answer would be Windows 10 with the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) option turned on. You can also run most, if not all, the GNU utilities there. Extra steps are needed though to run the Ubuntu GUI desktop in Windows 10:
