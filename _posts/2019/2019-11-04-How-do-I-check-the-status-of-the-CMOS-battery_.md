The `sensors` command doesn't output the CMOS battery voltage for my laptop. This article gives other pointers:

- [The Signs of a Bad CMOS Battery](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/the-signs-of-a-bad-cmos-battery)

To summarize the link:

> A constant beeping sound is another sign that your CMOS battery is

> Failure.
