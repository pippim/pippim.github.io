I don't condone political correctness as a fad but how about Triangle and Hour Glass. I'll leave it to the reader to figure out (no pun intended) which is male and which is female.

I'm not sure I like the other answer where females get "fitted" shirts implying that men get shirts that don't fit. From the other point of view males get "straight cut" and females are left with "not cut straight".
