First you need to change your boot order to Windows instead of Grub. To find out the key to press during boot to bring up the BIOS menu see:

- [The computer didn't automatically boot from USB,]({% post_url /2019/2019-10-13-The-computer-didn_t-automatically-boot-from-USB_ %})

Ignore the part about selecting device boot order, you want to change the UEFI boot order and move Windows to the top.

Then the instructions on `boot-repair` report tell you to boot into Windows and then:

>     For example you can boot into Windows, then type the following command in an admin command prompt:  
>     bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi  

Do this from Windows and then if it doesn't work revise your question with current status / new issues.

Also note boot-repair created 5 entries to boot Windows but in my experience they won't all work. After you fix the booting issues see this answer:

- [Boot-Repair created too many grub menu entries for Windows]({% post_url /2018/2018-04-06-Boot-Repair-created-too-many-grub-menu-entries-for-Windows %})
