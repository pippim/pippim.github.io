Another point to mention is you should prefix comments with @UserName because they will not know you made a comment to them.

For example on the same thread your comment to me an hour ago:

I did not get a notification. I only stumbled across it through the Q&A here about that question. I only stumbled across this Q&A because it appeared in General Chatroom as a new Meta Q&A advert.

To make a long story short, put @WinEunuuchs2Unix at the start of a comment you wish to make to me. Or as in the case of my last comment to you I put @dessert into the middle. That works too.
