**Conky** is a light weight system monitor you setup to show information you feel is important. In my version I have many data elements you seek plus information unique to myself like no one else cares about such as today's sunrise and sunset time for tracking automatic and gradual display brightening and dimming.

Check out my **Conky** setup with 2 second update interval but which you can set to 60 times a second or once every 5 minutes if you prefer:
