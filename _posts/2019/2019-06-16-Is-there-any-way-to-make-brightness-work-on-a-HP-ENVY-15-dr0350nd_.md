## Update June 16, 2019 2:44pm MST

It was revealed it's a "WLED" screen not an "OLED" screen we are interested in. Hope can be found in this [Linux Kernel Proposed Update][1] message:

## Original Answer

Although not an answer hoped for this [Arch Linux article][2] states:

> It may be helpful to know that OLED displays by their nature do not  
> have backlight.  

The only solution therefor is to use something like this:

``` 
$ xrandr --output eDP1 --brightness .5
```

- where `.5` is 50% brightness, `.63` would be 63% brightness, etc.
