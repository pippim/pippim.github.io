<!-- Language-all: lang-python -->

After logging into the console look edit this file:

``` 
/usr/share/pyshared/lsb_release.py

```

And around line 41 you will see:

``` 
RELEASES_ORDER.sort(key=lambda n: float(n[0]))

```

Change it to:

``` 
RELEASES_ORDER.sort(key=lambda n: float(n[0].split()[0]))

```
