Here are the [Canadian Instructions][1]:

You can install any kernel you want in Ubuntu:

- [How to update kernel to the latest mainline version without any Distro-upgrade?]({% post_url /2017/2017-02-20-How-to-update-kernel-to-the-latest-mainline-version-without-any-Distro-upgrade_ %})

without having to upgrade your desktop (eg 16.04 -> 18.04 -> 19.04) in order to get a new kernel version. Upgrading your desktop can result in operations loss (won't boot), in a steep learning curve and loss of functionality (but usually offset by gains in new functionality). Backups are strongly recommended when upgrading desktop. So you should plan carefully if all you want is a new kernel. Upgrading just a kernel (and keeping desktop) doesn't require a backup because the old kernel is still there to boot from.
