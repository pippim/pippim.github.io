You problem sounds like this one: [GRUB 2 “stuck” on particular boot option](https://superuser.com/questions/695143/grub-2-stuck-on-particular-boot-option)

The solution in answers:

> In this case the next_entry field didn't get cleared after a reboot  
> like it should have (perhaps due to some btrfs incompatibility?)  
>   
> I was successfully able to unset it like this (again, within the  
> chroot):  
>   
>     grub2-editenv /boot/grub2/grubenv unset next_entry  
>   
> After a reboot the grub menu was back to normal!
