From another report: [https://centos.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=7006](https://centos.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=7006)7 it would appear your system is being used for bitcoin mining. If you aren't doing it then your system may have been hacked and someone else is using your computer to mine bitcoins.
