Similar thing happened to me last week:

The battery was holding it's own but was not charging to full capacity when plugged in and turned on. Even when turned off and plugged in it still wasn't charging to full capacity.

The solution was to have it turned on, unplugged and then plug it back in at 6% life left. The other part of the solution was to not suspend while it was plugged in and still charging.
