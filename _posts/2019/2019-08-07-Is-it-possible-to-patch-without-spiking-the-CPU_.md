I think this [answer][1] contains everything you are looking for:

> OK, I managed myself to do the same you did, but with some changes:  

1) I installed the same utilities: 

``` 
sudo apt-get install cgroup-bin cgroup-lite cgroup-tools cgroupfs-mount libcgroup1
```

2) I edited conf files like this:

`sudo -H gedit /etc/init/cgroup-lite.conf`

``` 
description "mount available cgroup filesystems"
author "Serge Hallyn <serge.hallyn@canonical.com>"

start on mounted MOUNTPOINT=/sys/fs/cgroup

pre-start script
```
	test -x /bin/cgroups-mount || { stop; exit 0; }
	test -d /sys/fs/cgroup || { stop; exit 0; }
	/bin/cgroups-mount
	cgconfigparser -l /etc/cgconfig.conf
``` 
end script

post-stop script
```
	if [ -x /bin/cgroups-umount ]
	then
		/bin/cgroups-umount
	fi
``` 
end script
```

`sudo -H gedit /etc/cgconfig.conf`

``` 

# Since systemd is working well, this section may not be necessary.
# Uncomment if you need it
#
# mount {
# cpuacct = /cgroup/cpuacct;
# memory = /cgroup/memory;
# devices = /cgroup/devices;
# freezer = /cgroup/freezer;
# net_cls = /cgroup/net_cls;
# blkio = /cgroup/blkio;
# cpuset = /cgroup/cpuset;
# cpu = /cgroup/cpu;
# }

group limitcpu{
  cpu {
    cpu.shares = 400;
  }
}

group limitmem{
  memory {
    memory.limit_in_bytes = 512m;
  }
}

group limitio{
  blkio {
    blkio.throttle.read_bps_device = "252:0         2097152";
  }
}

group browsers {
    cpu {
#       Set the relative share of CPU resources equal to 25%
    cpu.shares = "256";
}
memory {
#       Allocate at most 512M of memory to tasks
        memory.limit_in_bytes = "512m";
#       Apply a soft limit of 512 MB to tasks
        memory.soft_limit_in_bytes = "384m";
    }
}

group media-players {
    cpu {
#       Set the relative share of CPU resources equal to 25%
        cpu.shares = "256";
    }
    memory {
#       Allocate at most 256M of memory to tasks
        memory.limit_in_bytes = "256m";
#       Apply a soft limit of 196 MB to tasks
        memory.soft_limit_in_bytes = "128m";
    }
}

cgconfigparser -l /etc/cgconfig.conf
```

`sudo -H gedit /etc/cgrules.conf`

``` 
user:process                                         subsystems   group
[user]:/usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromium-browser   cpu,memory      browsers
[user]:/usr/bin/clementine	            		  cpu,memory	 media-players
```

**Note: This section needs to be updated with `/usr/bin/apt`**

That is an example, use your username instead of [user]. You can add the applications you need to limit and define whether you want them to be CPU-, memory- or both limited.

I edited the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` line in `/etc/default/grub`:

``` 
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1"
```

Updating it: 
``` 

sudo update-grub
```

3) And finally rebooting to apply changes.
