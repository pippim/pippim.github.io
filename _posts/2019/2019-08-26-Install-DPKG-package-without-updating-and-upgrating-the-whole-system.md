I often avoid `sudo apt upgrade` for many weeks when my system is running well. If there is a particular need for example security or new app features I will run it. First I check **Ask Ubuntu** to ensure there are no new bugs reported with `upgrade`.

What I do when I want a new package is:

``` 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install paxkage-name
```

The `update` doesn't remove software as happened with your Firefox.

The `update` will tell me X packages are upgradable but I simply ignore the message until I have time to study what will get  upgraded.
