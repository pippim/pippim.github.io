It's not a bug it's a feature. Follow the steps from this answer:

- [Gnome Shell - How to prevent an application from starting behind the application in focus?](Gnome Shell - How to prevent an application from starting behind the application in focus?)

> Gnome Shell, which is used by Ubuntu, has the feature that launched  
> applications are opened in the background. While this may be desirable  
> in some workflows, many users will consider this an annoyance. A gnome  
> Shell extension, appropriately named "No Annoyance", changes this  
> behavior, and makes sure a launched application is immediately raised.  
>   
> Install the extension with the command `sudo apt install  
> gnome-shell-extension-no-annoyance`, or using Synaptic Manager (not  
> installed by default) or even using "Software". To enable the  
> extension after installation, you can use "Gnome Tweaks" (not  
> installed by default).
