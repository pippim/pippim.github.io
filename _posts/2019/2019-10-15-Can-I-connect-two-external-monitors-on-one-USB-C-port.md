The Link's fine print says only Windows supports the [Multi-Stream Transport](https://www.dell.com/support/article/ca/en/cabsdt1/sln295251/how-to-configure-u2415-monitor-daisy-chaining-on-intel-hd-graphics?lang=en) (MST) required to daisy chain two monitors. As such I suspect that is why monitors are mirrored.

Check with vendor perhaps there is a work around or it's not too late to return it and get your eighty bucks back.
