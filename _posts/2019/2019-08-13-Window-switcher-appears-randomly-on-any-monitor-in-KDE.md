On my system (**Ubuntu 16.04 Unity Interface**) the Window Switcher appears on the monitor where the mouse pointer is. You could get the same features in **18.04** or others in **19.04** if the Unity Interface is installed:

Of course this means abandoning KDE which you may not want to do!

Alternately, you can explore other Window Switchers via Gnome extensions:

- [Alternate Tab GNOME shell extension][1]
