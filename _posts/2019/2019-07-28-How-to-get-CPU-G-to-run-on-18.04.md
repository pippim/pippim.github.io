I couldn't find up-to-date information on `cpu-g`. In the meantime you might want to try `hardinfo` which you can install with:

``` 
sudo apt install hardinfo
```

Then typing `hardinfo` in the terminal or calling from Dash (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>) the gui appears like this:

You can get most if not all the information you need from `cpu-g` plus a whole lot more information on your machine.
