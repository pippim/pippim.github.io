## Original Answer

This thread has techniques you can use to narrow down the problem:

- [Nautilus 3.30 starts very slowly, and I see error messages running Nautilus from the terminal][2]

The next time it happens, rather than starting Nautilus from the GUI desktop or menu open a terminal and type `nautilus`. Then you will hopefully see some error messages that tell you the exact problem.

In the link above the solution hinted at was to use:

``` 
cp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc
```

Then edit the file `~/.xinitrc` and add the `dbus` command. On my system the end result would look like this:

``` 
$ cat ~/.xinitrc

#!/bin/sh

# /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
#
# global xinitrc file, used by all X sessions started by xinit (startx)

# invoke global X session script
. /etc/X11/Xsession
dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS DISPLAY XAUTHORITY
```
