Your first link isn't the only one provided by AMD. This page has separate AMD GPU drivers for Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04:

- [Radeon™ Software for Linux® 18.40 Highlights][1]

On the same page you will find links to instructions tailored for Linux users:

- [Radeon™ Software for Linux® Installation][2]

Within the instruction section you'll find a link for reporting bugs:

- [Generating a Bug Report][3]

This could be your best friend because even operating on CPU's iGPU alone there shouldn't be any lagging with youtube videos.
