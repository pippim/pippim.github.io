Rather than a wire (blue Ethernet cable) you can connect all devices over WiFi including Mac, Windows and Ubuntu. Here is one article on SSHFS:

- [How To Use SSHFS to Mount Remote File Systems Over SSH][1]

Then you can use Nautilus to access the other computer. In my case I did this with my phone and from Nautilus (or the terminal) I can access my phone's files from Ubuntu.
