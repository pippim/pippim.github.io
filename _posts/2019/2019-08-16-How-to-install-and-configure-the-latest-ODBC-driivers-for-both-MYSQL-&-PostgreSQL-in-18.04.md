You should always periodically copy your production environment to a test environment for user training and a development environment for yourself. You don't want your trials and errors effecting production (the company's bottom line) or user training (they are already enough challenge day to day without messing up their world).

That said, here are some newer ODBC (Open Database Connection) tutorials for you:

- [April 11, 2019 Connect to PostgreSQL Database on Linux, Windows][1]
- [August 16, 2019 MySQL show status: How to show open database connections][2]
