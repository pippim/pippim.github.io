# YES

Yes it is free as stated many times here:

- [Is Ubuntu Desktop free for a business solution?](Is Ubuntu Desktop free for a business solution?)

# BUT

In a 200 person company at $100K per head (salary + benefits + cost of desk space) it's a 20 million per year cost just for that plus inventory, warehousing, offices, consultants and contractors. The $50 cost x 200 machines for Windows is the least of your concerns.

Your computer systems will cost millions for accounting, operations and mission critical applications.

Your senior executives will cost $250K + and will come with their own preferences for JD Edwards running on AS/400, or SX.e running on Windows/Linux or Navision on Windows, or SAP on a variety of platforms.

Chances are 100 to 1 the people you hire that know spreadsheets (a big part of business) will know Microsoft's Excel and not Ubuntu's offerings.

So the cost of $50 / seat Windows 10 is really a moot point IMHO.
