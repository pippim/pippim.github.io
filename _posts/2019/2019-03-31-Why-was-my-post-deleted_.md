Firstly there is not really something universally dubbed a "post" here in AU. There are comments and answers.

Comments can be deleted or moved to discussion when the thread becomes too long, too much like an extended Q&A or too jovial.

Answers can be converted to a comment when a user doesn't have necessary rep to post a comment. Answers can be deleted when they are too personal or off-topic. I think your answer is rather a bit of both. This is how I would judged your case.

As far as assertion of being the answer being funny goes, I put you right up there with Muru as not being funny. Which is not a bad thing. I think yours and his answers are usually intelligent, succint and highly educational.

On this so-called answer of yours, whether it be construed a comment or not, I think suggesting banning Oli and/or Windy is over the top.

If you like a good joke though, I suggest trying our watered down Alberta Beer instead of Russian Vodka :)
