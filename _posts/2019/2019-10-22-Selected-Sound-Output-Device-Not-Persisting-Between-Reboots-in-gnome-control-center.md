I have had the bug report suggestions setup this way for along time as sound is always routed to TV and I don't want it to switch to tinny laptop speakers.

Use `sudo -H gedit /etc/pulse/default.pa` and find the lines:

``` 
load-module module-switch-on-port-available
load-module module-switch-on-connect
```

Change them to:

``` 
#load-module module-switch-on-port-available
#load-module module-switch-on-connect
```

Save the file and use: `pulseaudio -k`

**Note 1:** It's been reported that plain `sudo` now performs like `sudo -H` in 19.04 but caution dictates using later method.

**Note 2:** Earlier versions of Ubuntu will only have the first configuration line.
