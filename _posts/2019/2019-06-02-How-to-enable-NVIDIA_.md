## June 3, 2019 Update

Nvidia needs a working Xorg installation to operate within. As your current Xorg Gnome desktop is broken you can try the [Unity Desktop][1] to get nVidia drivers working first. 

``` 
sudo apt-get install unity-session
sudo apt-get install lightdm 
```

- And using TAB key select lightdm between "gdm3" and "lightdm" choices there, and press ENTER key to go.

I have a GTX 970M but I know this driver also works with the GTX 1060M which is one step above yours:

``` 
$ sudo ubuntu-drivers devices

== /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0 ==
model    : GM204M [GeForce GTX 970M]
vendor   : NVIDIA Corporation
modalias : pci:v000010DEd000013D8sv00001028sd00000708bc03sc02i00
driver   : nvidia-384 - distro non-free recommended
driver   : xserver-xorg-video-nouveau - distro free builtin

$ dmesg | grep -i nvidia

```

If you need sound turned on for your nVidia HDMI and most manufacturers these days have it powered off, then you need to use this:

- [Linux kernel module to toggle Nvidia HDMI audio device on/off on notebooks][2]

Here is someone that has taken the `prime-select` code and patched it because it wouldn't switch from `nvidia` to `intel`. If his patch doesn't help you perhaps he can?

- [NVIDIA-PRIME: Cant switch to intel](NVIDIA-PRIME: Cant switch to intel)
