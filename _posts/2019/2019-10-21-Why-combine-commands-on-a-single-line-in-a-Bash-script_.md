## Why we sometimes like to use it

When we are writing answers here in **Ask Ubuntu** it is helpful to put them into one line which people can cut and paste into their terminal easier. For example:

``` 
$ CurrDir=$PWD ; cd /bin ; ls -la dd ; cd "$CurrDir"

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 72632 Mar  2  2017 dd
```

As mentioned earlier you could use `&&` for the same effect but if there were errors above you could end up on the wrong directory. In this case `;` is preferable to `&&` that isn't tested for success:

``` 
rick@alien:~/askubuntu$ CurrDir=$PWD && cd /bin && llllssss -la dd && cd "$CurrDir"

llllssss: command not found

rick@alien:/bin$ 
```

## Why we have to use it

There are some commands where you have to string multiple lines together. One case is the abbreviated `if`-commands-`fi` which must be one line. For example:

``` 
$ [[ 2 -eq 2 ]] && { echo 2 equals 2 ; echo setting three to 3 ; three=3 ; }

2 equals 2
setting three to 3
```
