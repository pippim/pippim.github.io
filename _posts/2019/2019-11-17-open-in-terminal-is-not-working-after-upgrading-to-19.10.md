I don't have this problem with Ubuntu 16.04 and only have 19.04 installed on another partition which I haven't upgraded to 19.10 yet to test.

Your problem does sound like this one though:

- [Nautilus open terminal here](https://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?313877-Nautilus-open-terminal-here)

Please read the entire Q&A but to summarize the answer:

> You need to install gnome-terminal-nautilus or create a custom script.  

Then the follow up answer:

> ok, solved, I have change execute command in profile in to  
> gnome-shell. Not very intuitive
