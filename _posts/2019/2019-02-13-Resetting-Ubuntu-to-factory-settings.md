Reinstalling can mean erasing everything, reformatting the partition, loosing all data and installing Ubuntu with a brand new `/home/user` directory. This is the common result when doing a google search.

This answer is about reinstalling Ubuntu and ***keeping*** `/home/user` directory. The following is from: [Ubuntu Reinstallation][1]


----------


# Ubuntu Reinstallation

## Introduction

Sometimes reinstalling is the quickest way to solve a problem, for example if an upgrade failed or if your graphics driver is broken. When reinstalling, you're most likely want to preserve two things:

-    `/home` folder with your files and settings
-    Entries in boot menu (if you have multiple OS installed) 

## How To Reinstall Ubuntu

Since Hardy it is possible to reinstall Ubuntu without losing the content of the `/home` folder (the folder that contains program settings, internet bookmarks, emails and all your documents, music, videos and other user files). This can be done even if /home is not on a separate partition (which is the case by default if you did not manually separate it when installing Ubuntu originally). This tutorial can also be used to upgrade Ubuntu (eg 11.04 -> 12.04 from a 12.04 live-CD).

## Before doing anything

This operation should not damage your documents but, for security, backup your documents and settings (including /home hidden files) on external disk or DVDs. (eg via CloneZilla) Note: Some special applications settings may be in system folders, eg LAMP, see below in the thread.

## Run the Ubuntu installer

-    Run the UbuntuInstaller
-    Follow the prompts until the "Installation type" (or "Allocate disk space") menu
-    Choose the right option as described below: 

### Choose the right option

There are two possibilities - choose the one that fits what the installer is showing:

- If an "**Upgrade 1X.XX to 1Y.YY**" option is available (like in the screenshot below), choose it.

- Or, if the above option is not available, choose manual partitioning ("Something-else" option), then select Ubuntu system partition, set its mount point as "/". Be sure to keep the same format type, the same size, and untick the "Format" checkbox or all data on "/" will be deleted!. Also set other partitions (/boot, /home... see DiskSpace) if needed.

Then finish the installation process. (this may take several hours, like a normal install)

## After reinstalling

After reinstalling, user accounts must be re-created with the same login and password.
