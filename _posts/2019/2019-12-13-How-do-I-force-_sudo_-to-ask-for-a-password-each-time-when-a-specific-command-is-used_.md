# `rm` wrapper script

Sometime ago I wrote a wrapper script for the `rm` command:

- [How can I set up a password for the 'rm' command?]({% post_url /2016/2016-12-30-How-can-I-set-up-a-password-for-the-_rm_-command_ %})

Some of the notable features:

- An encrypted password must be used each time `rm` is called unless it is being used within a batch job like `sudo apt-get` or `sudo update-grub`.
- Ensure top level directories are never removed even if a relative path was passed.
- Every time `rm` is used it is logged to `journalctl` and `/var/log/syslog`.
