Firstly, an easier way of mounting is to use:

``` 
mount -t auto /dev/sdb /media/usb-drive
```

This way you are spared the magical incantations of specifying a partition type.

Secondly, you may have errors on the drive and/or the partition table may be damaged. This happened to me when using `dd` to erase the first MB of a USB on `/dev/sdd` and I accidentally used `/dev/sdb`. This wiped out the first 1 MB of my second hard disk containing the MBR (Master Boot Record) and partition table.

**TestDisk** can be downloaded [here][1] and has versions for Windows and Linux. It goes through every byte of your hard drive to analyze what partition type it is and rebuilds the partition tables. I used TestDisk to successfully recover all my data.

From the website, TestDisk can:

- Fix partition table, recover deleted partition
- Recover FAT32 boot sector from its backup
- Rebuild FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 boot sector
- Fix FAT tables
- Rebuild NTFS boot sector
- Recover NTFS boot sector from its backup
- Fix MFT using MFT mirror
- Locate ext2/ext3/ext4 Backup SuperBlock
- Undelete files from FAT, exFAT, NTFS and ext2 filesystem
- Copy files from deleted FAT, exFAT, NTFS and ext2/ext3/ext4 partitions.
