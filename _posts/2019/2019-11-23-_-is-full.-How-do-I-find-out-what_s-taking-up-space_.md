The other answer recommends installing `ncdu` which appears to be a great tool and loved by many users. However this is a "Catch 22" situation because when you are out of disk space you usually can't install a program to find out why because... you have no disk space.

The only option is to use a program already installed:

``` 
$ sudo du -cha --max-depth=1 --exclude=/mnt / 2>/dev/null

40M 	/core
1.7G	/var
6.5M	/dev
15M 	/bin
3.4M	/tmp
681M	/opt
6.5G	/usr
4.4G	/lib
3.9M	/lib32
17M 	/root
15M 	/etc
1.1G	/boot
12G 	/home
13M 	/sbin
1.8M	/run
26G 	/
26G 	total
```
