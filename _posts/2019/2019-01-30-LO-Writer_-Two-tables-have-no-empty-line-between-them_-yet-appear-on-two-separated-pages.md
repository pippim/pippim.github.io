Without having your actual document to work with I came up with this link:

There are two answers posted on the link summarized below:

### Answer 1:

- Right-click in the table, and choose Table.
- Click the Text Flow tab.
- Clear the Break check box.

### Answer 2:

- This answer has graphics so visit the link above to see it. It looks like it might not be helpful but you should verify.
