# Relabel Zenity Cancel button

You can relabel the button but you can't remove it:

``` 
$ zenity --list --cancel-label="Go Back" --column="Column 1"
```

Will give you:

# YAD (Yet Another Dialog)

Both `yad` and `zenity` allow you to use GUI dialog boxes from a bash script or the shell command line. Yad surpasses Zenity in every department though:

``` 
sudo apt install yad
```

Works in all distros.


----------


## Yad Progress bars

You can define multiple progress bars in yad where zenity only offers 1. You can also include scrolling text.


----------


## Yad buttons

You can assign any text you want to any button. Also notice you can include a Window icon too.


----------


## Yad text entry

Yad displays text for you to change. Zenity cannot display existing text you can only enter new text.


----------


## Yad support

The author of Yad and many more contributors answer your questions in [google groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/yad-common). I've posted four or five questions about advanced functionality and usually get an answer within 24 hours. Not to mention enhancements are provided through the same channel.
