I wrote the [iconic script][1] to give control over which monitor icons are placed on. It also ensures icons don't get placed into the "black hole" that exists when monitors of different resolutions are used.

Here are a few screenshots of `iconic` to give you an idea of how it works.

On this notebook tab you can also specify the number of seconds a test will last. Press the <kbd>Test</kbd> button to place icons on the Desktop using currently defined each time you change the reserved screen space.

### iconic Monitors Notebook Monitor 3 tab

Assign a user friendly name to each monitor. Set the number of rows and columns to utilize for icon placement on each monitor.

Use the <kbd>Test</kbd> button to view what icon placement after number or columns and/or rows are changed.
