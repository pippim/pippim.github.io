There is an override in grub for when the timeout is 0 seconds to replace it with 10 seconds. Rather than editing grub scripts as other answers recommend you can simply use:

``` 
GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT="0.0"
GRUB_TIMEOUT="0.0"
```

This will work because the grub overrides will not find `"0"` to be equal to `"0.0"`.
