I could but won't make observations on specific user's conduct I've noticed myself. FWIW I've never lodged a complaint.

I will say that I received a 30 minute suspension in Ask Ubuntu General Chat Room which was good for me:

- It made me reflect on the feelings of others.
- The world can be politically biased to left and right extremes so jokes about politicians and mainstream media should be avoided.

After the 30 minute suspension ended I didn't hang out in the room as much as before. Perhaps only 1 to 5% as much?

Suspension taught me a lesson which it is designed to do. It doesn't matter how brilliant a person is here. Brilliance alone doesn't make one a shining star in diplomatic tact.
