## You can still use LO Writer with `pandoc`

Because LibreOffice supports MS Word `.doc` files, this popular answer from Stack Exchange might work for you:

- [How can doc/docx files be converted to markdown or structured text?][1]

> Pandoc supports conversion from docx to markdown directly:  
>   
>     pandoc -f docx -t markdown foo.docx -o foo.markdown  
>   
> Several markdown formats are supported:  
>   
>     -t gfm (GitHub-Flavored Markdown)  
>     -t markdown_mmd (MultiMarkdown)  
>     -t markdown (pandocâ€™s extended Markdown)  
>     -t markdown_strict (original unextended Markdown)  
>     -t markdown_phpextra (PHP Markdown Extra)  
>     -t commonmark (CommonMark Markdown)  

It also supports LibreOffice native `.odt` format as illustrated in these [30 examples][2].

## DOCX style sheets are supported better than ODT style sheets

As a github reference page notes in: [Defining custom DOCX styles in LibreOffice (and Word)][3]

> In case you wonder LibreOffice handles DOCX documents very well, and  
> Pandoc works well with a reference docx file which has been  
> modified in LibreOffice.  This is good because as of Pandoc 1.19.2.1  
> DOCX support is superior to ODT support in Pandoc, notably including  
> the custom-style attribute feature which doesn't work for ODT.  

Visit this github page for all kinds of great tips using pandoc.

## Try it online before installing

You can try the [pandoc online conversion tool][4] before installing locally.
