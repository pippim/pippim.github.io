Obviously you can't rename "alex" to "alex" so you need to rename "1001" to "1000" instead. This answer appears to work for you:

- [Change gid of a specific group](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/33874/200094)

Read the entire Q&A but in summary (if you agree it works for you) use:

``` 
find / -gid 1001 ! -type l -exec chgrp 1000 {} \;
```

You might also want to change the group name for GID 1001 to "alex2". This will make it easier to spot files you may have missed.
