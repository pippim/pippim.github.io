This question is probably a duplicate of:

- [capture stdout and stderr of all GUI programs?](capture stdout and stderr of all GUI programs?)

There are two answers there:

- Check the contents of `~/.xsession-errors` log and,
- Redirect output when calling command: `command >~/log/command.out.log 2>~/log/command.err.log`

Also if the process ID is known look at it's file descriptor `1` for stdout and `2` for stderr. This is described in detail in Unix & Linux:

- [Where does the output from an application started from the window manager go?][1]

To briefly summarize the top-voted answer:

``` 
lsof -p1234 | awk '$4 ~ /^[12][^0-9]/'
ls -l /proc/1234/fd/[12]
```

Of course the most common method is to simply call the GUI from the command line and your terminal window will show warning and error messages:

``` 
$ zenity --info --text "Hello World"
Gtk-Message: GtkDialog mapped without a transient parent. This is discouraged.
```
