After you've install **Unity Desktop** and, logged into it, use:

``` 
sudo apt remove ubuntu-gnome-desktop
sudo apt remove gnome-shell

```

This works for for Ubuntu **16.04** to **20.04** and even **20.10** (Groovy). Source:

----------


Although article is written for Ubuntu **16.04**, you can verify the package is still around for **20.04** (called Focal) by visiting https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/ubuntu-gnome-desktop:

Personally I use **Unity** all the time but like to keep both desktops installed. Occasionally I need to answer other users' questions about **Gnome Desktop**.


----------

## Note: `ubuntu-gnome-desktop` might not be installed

Because it is a transitional package since 18.04 these instructions from:

- [Why and How to Install Unity 7 Desktop on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS][3]

Tell you to simply use:

``` 
sudo apt remove gnome-shell

```

The article doesn't mention `ubuntu-gnome-desktop` needing to be removed. This article includes additional tips on setting up **Unity Desktop**.
