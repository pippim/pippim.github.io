From: [Ubuntu Forums - Intel Centrino Wireless-N 2230 connection is very slow][1]

Success was found using:

``` 
echo "options iwlwifi 11n_disable=8" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf

```

Of course since you've alread setup the `iwlwifi` option you can simply change the `0` to an `8`.

Apparently `0` was old school and `8` is for newer drivers (sometime before September 2014 when OP posted question).
