Yes this is the sixth section. And yes "How" doesn't begin with a "W". But as they say:

> Who, What, Where, When, Why and sometimes How

Many hours went into finding a name that:

1. Was easy to remember
2. Was six characters of less
3. Was two syllables
4. Could be typed with the right hand only
5. Did not contain "-" or digits like "9", "0", etc.
6. Ended in ".com" instead of ".net" or ".org", etc.
7. Wasn't a name already reserved and being sold for thousands of dollars
8. Could be purchased from Google Domains with good security and performance

After finding the name "pippim" was available weeks of contemplation went by before pulling the trigger and buying it for $17 CAD per year.

Then the `www.pippim.com` website was created using Google Sites for free.

Then the `pippim.github.io` website was created using Github Pages for free.

### Hopefully you enjoy the freedom! :)
