## Github Pages

This website was created (for free) on **Github Pages**. You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/pippim/pippim.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Table of Contents support

To get a Table of Contents (TOC) insert `{ % include toc.md % }` at the place you want it. All your markdown headers with `#`, `##` and `###`, etc. are used to create the TOC. Note there is no space between `{ %` and `% }` in the command but, spaces had to be added to show the commnd. The real TOC command is used on the next line:

{% include toc.md %}

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pippim/pippim.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Images, Javascript, CSS and HTML

These are the file types in the pippim website:

- Images are stored in `assets/img`
- SCSS (a superset of CSS) files are stored in `assets/css`
- HTML can be found in any file, including markdown files which end in `.md`. Pure HTML files can be found in the `_includes` directory
