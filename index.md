## Github Pages<a name="hdr3"></a>

This website was created (for free) on **Github Pages**. You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/pippim/pippim.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Table of Contents support<a name="hdr5"></a>

To get a Table of Contents (TOC) insert `{ % include toc.md % }` at the place you want it. All your markdown headers with `#`, `##` and `###`, etc. are used to create the TOC. Note there is no space between `{ %` and `% }` in the command but, spaces had to be added to show the commnd. The real TOC command is used on the next line:

{% include toc.md %}<a name="hdr6"></a>

<a href="#hdr1" class="button">Top</a><a href="#hdr6" class="button">ToS</a><a href="#hdr6" class="button">ToC</a><a href="#hdr8" class="button">Skip</a>
### Jekyll Themes<a name="hdr7"></a>

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pippim/pippim.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
