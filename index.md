# Introduction

Welcome to Pippim. A collection of questions and answers about using your computer, especially in Linux and specifically Ubuntu. All the solutions are free. You can use them as you like. There are also full-fledged applications that are free for you to use as well.

There are no ads on Pippim. You don't need to buy Pippim a coffee (it's already free at work!). Maybe some day you'll want to put all your technial documentation on an intranet or website and you will contract Pippim to help get the job done. Custom projects are the business model for how Pippim will earn revenue.

If you are an aspiring developer perhaps the code published here will help you get a start. If you are a systems administrator perhaps you can learn from the questions and answers posted here. If in Technical Support remember "Google search is your friend" and many answers posted here come from using the *Google Search* engine.

## Navigation Buttons

In this section we will discuss the *Page Navigation Buttons* that appear on the top of each page. Then we will discuss the *Section Navigation Buttons* that can appear at the top of major sections.

### Page Navigation Buttons

The top of each page contains navigation buttons to take you to other pages:

- <kbd>‚åÇ Home</kbd> brings you to this page.

- <kbd>‚ùì About</kbd> disccusses everything you want to know about Pippim. Still have questions? Just email.

- <kbd>‚úÖ Answers</kbd> to questions people have using computers. Pippim questions and answers have 51 **million** views!

- <kbd>üíª Programs</kbd> are applicationss Pippim created to make your life easier.

- <kbd>üìß Email</kbd> lets you send an email to Pippim.

> ***NOTE:*** &ensp;When you click a button to go to a page, that button will disappear and be replace by another. The page you are currently on will not display it's own button. This was done to limit number of buttons on mobile user screens. This technique deviates from conventional website design as of November 2, 2021. Perhaps this technique will be adopted in the future by other websites though. üòÑ

### Section Navigation Buttons

The top of major sections contain navigation buttons to take you to other sections:

- <kbd>Top</kbd> - Displays the top of the page

- <kbd>ToS</kbd> - Displays the top of the previous section

- <kbd>ToC</kbd> - Displays the Table of Contents

- <kbd>Skip</kbd> - Skips the section and displays the next section

Github Pages
==

This website was created on **Github Pages**. You can download (or simply view) this website [on GitHub](https://github.com/pippim/pippim.github.io/edit/main/index.md "See this website code on Github Pages"). This current page for example you can find in the markdown file called `index.md`.

**TL;DR**

"TL;DR" stands for "Too Long, Didn't Read". Unless you are truly interested in the technology of websites and how this website in particular was created, you will probably want to stop reading the rest of this page.

Whenever you commit to a website repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "See how Jekyll rebuilds Github Pages websites") to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

The Pippim website is based on the Github Pages Jekyll theme called [Cayman](https://pages-themes.github.io/cayman/ "Visit the Cayman Theme for Github Pages website"). Initial setup is straight forward. If you want custom buttons it becomes more complicated as you need to learn [HTML](https://blog.webjeda.com/new-page-jekyll/ "See how HTML is used in Jekyll") and [Sass/SCSS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/sass/ "See how Sass is used in Jekyll").

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for:

```
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Convert Stack Exchange Q&A to Jekyll Blog Post

Some Pippim programs use *Web Scraping*. Examples are **Roboto** to get price changes, **eyesome** to get sunrise/sunset times and **mserve** to get music lyrics. 

Other Pippim programs use *APIs*. Examples are **bserve** to get gmail messages, **tvpowered** to monitor TV remote power button to put your system to sleep and **mserve** to get CD Audio track names and album covert art images. 

This Pippim website creates 2,000 blog posts using a different technique than *Web Scraping* or *REST APIs*, called *Data Conversion*. Data conversion allows thousands of website pages to be created with ***no work!***. You do have to do the first two steps below:

1. The first step is to run a [Stack Exchange Data Explorer query](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1505559/all-my-posts-on-the-se-network-with-markdown-and-html-content-plus-editors-and-s?AccountId=4775729). Many thanks to the the query's [Author](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/371435/366359).

2. Next a Python program called `stack-blog-post.py` is run. It does all the magic described below. This program was extensively debugged and tested to work on Pippim's markdown answers in Stack Exchange. Note that your markdown answers might be using extra features not tested.

3. Pippim adds navigation bar buttons (Top, ToS, ToC and Skip) by putting HTML code into the markdown files. Then HTML code controls jumping to id tags when a button is clicked. Here's an easy-to-read example of the HTML code:
  
    ``` html
    # Introduction
    
    Welcome to Pippim. A collection of questions and answers about...
    
    <a id="hdr2"></a>
    <div class="hdr-bar">
      <a href="#" class="hdr-btn">Top</a>
      <a href="#hdr1" class="hdr-btn">ToS</a>
      <a href="#hdr6" class="hdr-btn">ToC</a>
      <a href="#hdr3" class="hdr-btn">Skip</a>
    </div>
    
    ## Get in touch
    
    Get in touch with pippim by sending an email. You can also...
    ```

4. In the markdown file that `stack-to-blog.py` creates, the HTML id tag and navigation bar buttons aren't as easy to read but accomplish the same task:

    ``` html
    <a id="hdr2"></a>
    <div class="hdr-bar">  <a href="#" class="hdr-btn">Top</a>  <a href="#hdr1" class="hdr-btn">ToS</a>  <a href="#hdr6" class="hdr-btn">ToC</a>  <a href="#hdr3" class="hdr-btn">Skip</a></div>
    
    ## Get in touch
    ```

5. Two extra spaces are added between HTML elements for readability and some extra spacing between buttons. A blank line is added before the HTML id tag and after the HTML button bar for readability. Because the markdown interpreter condenses multiple blank lines into a single blank line, the HTML code has no effect on line spacing.

6. If you would like to modify the button properties (position, color, size, hover, etc), the header button bar (`hdr-bar`) and individual buttons (`hdr-btn`) are defined in filename `assets/css/style.scss`:

    ``` scss
    .hdr-bar {
      display: block;
      position: relative;
      width: 100%;
      height: .5rem;            // Add bit extra for button box height
      text-align: right;        // Don't use "float: right;" that renders backwards
      &:before {
          content: "";
          display: block;
        }
      }
      
      .hdr-btn {
        display: inline-block;
        position: relative;
        color: $header-bg-color;  // Cayman green
        padding: 5px 15px;        // vertical, horizontal padding around button text
        font-size:0.75em;         // 75% of normal font for button text
        margin-left: 10px;        // Now that right aligned, switch margin side
        // From: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65297617
        background: linear-gradient(transparent,rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)) top/100% 800%;
        background-color:#F0FFF0; // Honeydew
      
        &:hover {
          background-position:bottom;
          color:#F0FFF0;
        }
      }
      ```

7. Block quotes are defined in Stack Exchange like this:
```
> line 1
> line 2
```
    7.1. If they were not modified they would display on Github Pages Markdown as:
    > line 1
    > line 2

    7.2. Pippim appends two spaces to the end of block quotes in Stack Exhange answers so they render properly:
    > line 1  
    > line 2  

8. **Note:** You can open one of the blog posts and compare it to the Stack Exchange original answer.

9. Pippim will take older markdown format on Stack Exchange Answers where `#Header` was used and convert it to `# Header`.

10. The alternate H1 markdown format "`Header 1`" line followed by a "`==`" line are converted to "`# Header 1`". The alternate H2 markdown format "`Header 2`" line followed by a "`--`" line are converted to "`## Header 2`". Trailing "==" and "--" lines are converted to blank lines.

11. Pippim converts Stack Exchange tags formated as: `<Tag1><Tag2><Tag3>` and converts them to: `tags: Tag1 Tag2 Tag3` for Jekyll *front matter*.

12. Pippim setups the Jekyll front matter as required for Title and sets the blog filename as expected. However it also allows custom front matter for URL, Votes, Last Edit Date, etc.

A preview of `stack-to-blog.py` is presented a few sections below and the full program can be accessed on the <kbd>üíª Programs</kbd> page.

<a id="hdr5"></a>
<div class="hdr-bar">  <a href="#" class="hdr-btn">Top</a>  <a href="#hdr4" class="hdr-btn">ToS</a>  <a href="#hdr6" class="hdr-btn">ToC</a>  <a href="#hdr6" class="hdr-btn">Skip</a></div>

## How the Table of Contents is generated

All markdown headers with `#`, `##` and `###`, etc. are used to create the **Table of Contents** (TOC). A little bit of one-time prep work is required for TOC support. For example, the file `_sass/toc.scss` is setup with:

``` scss
.screen-reader-only {
    position: absolute;
    left: -5000px;

    &:focus {
        left: 0;
    }
}
```

Another one-time setup is the file `_includes/toc.md` containing the markdown for how the TOC looks and functions. This file contains:

``` sass
## Table of Contents
{:.no_toc}

* TOC
{:toc}
```

To get a Table of Contents (TOC) in any website page, insert a liquid tag where you want the TOC to appear. For example on this website page you are reading (`index.md`) you would see the following markdown code:

    ``` html
    ... on the next line and generates the **Table of Contents** you see below:
    
    { % include toc.md % }
    
    <a id="hdr7"></a>
    <div class="hdr-bar">  <a href="#" class="hdr-btn">Top</a> ... </div>
    ```

*Note:* a space was inserted above between `{` and `%` above to prevent [Jekyll's liquid processor](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/introduction-to-liquid/) from interpreting them as a real command. Remove that space as well as the space between `%` and `}` above in real code. The TOC command is used in real markdown below and generates the actual TOC:

<a id="hdr6"></a>
<div class="hdr-bar">  <a href="#" class="hdr-btn">Top</a>  <a href="#hdr5" class="hdr-btn">ToS</a>  <a href="#hdr7" class="hdr-btn">Skip</a></div>

{% include toc.md %}

<a id="hdr7"></a>
<div class="hdr-bar">  <a href="#" class="hdr-btn">Top</a>  <a href="#hdr6" class="hdr-btn">ToS</a>  <a href="#hdr6" class="hdr-btn">ToC</a>  <a href="#hdr8" class="hdr-btn">Skip</a></div>

Jekyll Themes
--

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pippim/pippim.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

To see the current Jekyll, Sass, Rouge version numbers, etc. used by **Github Pages** click [here](https://pages.github.com/versions/). It is very important to find the correct documentation version when you are using instructions for setting up your website!

<a id="hdr8"></a>
<div class="hdr-bar">  <a href="#" class="hdr-btn">Top</a>  <a href="#hdr7" class="hdr-btn">ToS</a>  <a href="#hdr6" class="hdr-btn">ToC</a>  <a href="#hdr9" class="hdr-btn">Skip</a></div>

## Images, Javascript, CSS and HTML

It is important to follow these instructions to setup your site: [Adding a theme to your GitHub Pages site using Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)

Otherwise Jekyll documentation itself could break your Github Pages theme you've chosen. For example, `_layouts/default.html` needs to be copied from the theme to make significant changes to the theme.

These are the file types in the pippim website:

- A few local images are stored in `assets/img/` directory. The hundreds of images in blog posts come directly from Stack Exchange and are not stored in `pippim.github.io`.
- SCSS and [Sass CSS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-difference-between-scss-and-sass/) files are mostly stored in the `assets/css/` directory. Some are stored in the `_sass/` directory. The `_sass/` directory has files you can't see in `pippim.github.io` because they are really stored in the Cayman Theme for Jekyll and automatically pulled from there whenever website is rendered.
- This <kbd>‚åÇ Home</kbd> page is stored in `index.md` file in the root directory (`/`).
- The <kbd>‚ùì About</kbd> page is stored in `about.md` in `/`.
- The <kbd>‚úÖ Answers</kbd> page is stored in `answers.md` in `/`. Individual answers are internally known as "blog posts" and are stored in the `_posts` directory with one file per answer.
- The <kbd>üíª Programs</kbd> page is stored in `programs.md` in `/`.
- HTML encoding can be found in any file. Small bits and pieces of HTML can beven be found in andmarkdown files which end in `.md`. Pure HTML files (with no markdown or CSS) can be found in the `_includes` directory.
- As of November 4, 2021 this website doesn't include and **Javascript** but typically you would place those files in `assets/js/`.

### Pippim Website Directory Tree

## Python Program (stack-to-blog.py* Overview

To generate this site's blog posts (which are really Stack Excahgne Answers), the Python program `stack-to-blog.py` was used. Here is how Jekyll front matter is controlled:

``` python
FRONT_SITE = "site: "
FRONT_POST_ID = None
FRONT_URL = "stack_url: "
FRONT_LINK = None
FRONT_TYPE = None
FRONT_TITLE = "title: "
FRONT_HTML = None
FRONT_MARKDOWN = None
FRONT_TAGS = "tags: "
FRONT_CREATED = None
FRONT_LAST_EDIT = "edit_date: "
FRONT_EDITED_BY = None
FRONT_SCORE = "votes: "
FRONT_FAVORITES = None
FRONT_VIEWS = "views: "
FRONT_ANSWERS = None
FRONT_ACCEPTED = "accepted: "
FRONT_CW = None
FRONT_CLOSED = None
```
  
Here is how you control settings for which answers (or even questions you posted) get deployed. Also how to control Table of Contents (TOC) and Navigation Bar Buttons between major sections:

``` python
INPUT_FILE = 'QueryResults.csv'
RANDOM_LIMIT = 10           # On initial trials limit the number of blog posts
PRINT_RANDOM = True         # Print out matching random record found (10 lines)
OUTPUT_DIR = "_posts/"      # Subdirectory name. Use "./" for current directory
QUESTIONS = False           # Don't upload questions
VOTE_QUALIFIER = 2          # Answers need at least 2 votes to qualify
ACCEPTED_QUALIFIER = True   # All accepted answers are uploaded
# Don't confuse above with row 'ACCEPTED' index or the flag 'FRONT_ACCEPTED'

''' Table of Contents (TOC) options. '''
CONTENTS = "{ % TOC % }"      # If TOC not wanted, set to None
TOC_HDR_MIN = 6             # Number of Headers required to qualify TOC insert
TOC_LOC = 2                 # Put TOC before second second paragraph

NAV_BAR_OPT = 4             # Insert Navigation Bar into markdown?
''' 0 = No navigation bar
    1 = single line. EG <a id=... </div>
    2 = two lines. EG <a id= then new line then with <div>...</div>
    3 = Option 2 plus empty (blank) line above for readability
    4 = Option 3 plus empty (blank) line above for even more readability
    5 = Option 4 plus comment for ultimate readability

    Note: Markdown compresses all blank lines into a single blank line between
          paragraphs. HTML code inserted simply counts as another blank line to
          be compressed into a single blank line.
'''
NAV_BAR_LEVEL = 2           # Only for "#" or "##". Not for "###", "####", etc.
NAV_FORCE_TOC = True        # Put TOC to navigation bar regardless of "#"
NAV_BAR_MIN = 3             # Temporary. Really need minimum paragraphs too.
```

**NOTE:** This is still a WIP (Work In Progress) and as of November 9, 2021 the program still isn't finished.

When the `stack-to-blog.py` finishes a summary appears on your screen:

```  css
=================================   T O T A L S   ==================================
accepted_count:      620  | total_votes:         7,053  | total_views:    51,804,222
question_count:      298  | answer_count:        2,139  | unknown_count:           2
total_headers:     3,884  | total_header_spaces:   526  | total_quote_spaces:  2,464
total_lines:      93,781  | total_paragraphs:   27,199  | total_words:       536,892
total_code_blocks:   662  | code_block_lines:   11,243
total_pre_codes:       0  | Alternate H1:            0  | Alternate H2:           52
Six Header level counts:    [1467, 1957, 452, 8, 0, 0]
```

You may have to tweak the code if your numbers are much larger than mine:

``` python
print('=================================   T O T A L S   ==================================')
print('accepted_count:   {:>6,}'.format(accepted_count),
      ' | total_votes:   {:>11,}'.format(total_votes),
      ' | total_views:   {:>11,}'.format(total_views))
print('question_count:   {:>6,}'.format(question_count),
      ' | answer_count:       {:>6,}'.format(answer_count),
      ' | unknown_count:      {:>6,}'.format(unknown_count))
print('total_headers:    {:>6,}'.format(total_headers),
      ' | total_header_spaces:{:>6,}'.format(total_header_spaces),
      ' | total_quote_spaces: {:>6,}'.format(total_quote_spaces))
print('total_lines: {:>11,}'.format(total_lines),
      ' | total_paragraphs:{:>9,}'.format(total_paragraphs),
      ' | total_words: {:>13,}'.format(total_words))
print('total_code_blocks:{:>6,}'.format(total_code_blocks),
      ' | Code Block Lines:  {:>7,}'.format(total_code_block_lines))
print('total_pre_codes:  {:>6,}'.format(total_pre_codes),
      ' | Alternate H1:       {:>6,}'.format(total_alternate_h1),
      ' | Alternate H2:       {:>6,}'.format(total_alternate_h2))
print('Six Header level counts:   ', total_header_levels)
```
