*Tim-ta* (**Tim**ed-**ta**sks) gives a countdown timer
where each task is always a predetermined amount of time.
For example, when doing the laundry it might be:

- 16 minutes and 30 seconds for the wash cycle
- 13 minutes and 15 seconds for the rinse cycle
- 58 minutes and 40 seconds for the dryer

With Tim-ta you arrive at the washer and dryer the exact
second you need to be there. You'll Never miss the rinse
cycle fabric softener to eliminate static cling. You'll 
never have wrinkled clothes from being left overnight in
the dryer. It doesn't stop you from mixing red and white
fabrics in hot water to end up with PINK clothes though!

# Work In Progress

Tim-ta development started April 11, 2022. A budget of two months
has been given to this project.

Initially all the features in 
[Multi-Timer](https://www.pippim.com/programs/mt.html)
will be provided. After that, new features will be added. 

> NOTE: Some Multi-timer features such as locking the screen
> cannot be done from a web browser.

As of April 14, 2022 these features have been developed:

- Three Sound files are saved to local storage. This saves bandwidth when they are played.

As a four day week-end starts on April 15, 2022, lots
of development should occur!
