*Tim-ta* (**Tim**ed-**ta**sks) gives a countdown timer
where each task is always a predetermined amount of time.
For example, when doing the laundry it might be:

- 16 minutes and 30 seconds for the wash cycle
- 13 minutes and 15 seconds for the rinse cycle
- 58 minutes and 40 seconds for the dryer

With Tim-ta you arrive at the washer and dryer the exact
second you need to be there. You'll Never miss the rinse
cycle fabric softener to eliminate static cling. You'll 
never have wrinkled clothes from being left overnight in
the dryer. It doesn't stop you from mixing red and white
fabrics in hot water to end up with PINK clothes though!
