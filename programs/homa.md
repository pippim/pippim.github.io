# Introduction

**HomA** (Home Automation) automatically searches LAN, WiFi and Bluetooth.
It allows you to turn devices on and off from your computer. Devices such as:

- Televisions
- Smart plugs (ideally controlling Bias Lights behind TVs)
- Bluetooth LED light strips

The first five fields are parameters you can control:

| Field                  | Internal argument name                                         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dimmest value          | `low` value is 4. If too low light will be off.                |
| Brightest value        | `high` value is 30. Max is 255 but is way to bright.           |
| Dimmest hold seconds   | `bots` value is 1.5. Abbreviation is for "bottom seconds".     |
| Brightest hold seconds | `tops` value is 0.5. Abbreviation is for "top seconds".        |
| Breathe duration       | `span` value is 6.0. Longer span allows gradual color change.  |
| Step duration          | `step` value is 0.275. Longer step allows regular refresh.     |

## Under Construction

**HomA** is still under construction. Installation requires
manually downloading files from GitHub and installing any
missing dependencies with `apt get install` in Debian/Ubuntu
or `pip install` on other Operating Systems.


> ***IMPORTANT NOTES:*** 
> 
> - **HomA** was primarily tested with Linux, specifically 
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ECM/Plus and Python 2.7.12.
> 
> - You *"should"* be able to toggle between Pyhon 2.7.x and 
Python 3.x by changing the *"shebang"* at the top of each `.py`. 
Currently, **HomA** *"should"* run with the default Python version.
Testing on Python 3.x will begin prior to next major **HomA** upgrade.
> 
> - Current plans are to upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Python 3.12 
in year 2025. A "lite" Ubuntu 16.04 version running Unity may be 
created as some sort of virtual machine. It's already been announced 
that Ubuntu 24.04 (via Debian) will not ship with Python 2.7 anymore.


## **HomA** Installation

**HomA** (Home Automation) is written in Python.
The main program is called `homa.py` and can be found in the 
[HomA GitHub Repository â§‰ ðŸ”—](https://github.com/pippim/HomA/blob/main/src/homa.py 
"View HomA Python source code"){:target="_blank"}. 

Copy all the files (including the subdirectories) 
in the GitHub `src` folder to a new directory on your computer. 
For example, `<HOME>/HomA` for Linux, Mac, Chrome OS or 
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Unless you are running Ubuntu 16.04
LTS under Extended Security Maintenance (ESM), you may have to make
changes to `homa.py` and the programs it calls. 

For Windows, the installation directory would be  `<HOME>\HomA`
As of {{ site.refreshed | date: "%B %e, %Y" }}
**HomA** will not run under Windows without modification.

`homa.py` is called with `m` from the command line or a 
desktop shortcut. It is recommended you start using **HomA**
from the command line to see any error messages that might
appear.

`homa-indicator.py` is a Python script that allows access 
to **HomA** from the taskbar of any monitor.

`homa-indicator.py` and `homa.py` do not need to be added to your path.
You can call them with `/path/to/homa-indicator.py` or `/path/to/homa.py` 
from the command line. If you followed the installation tip 
above, it would be `<HOME>/HomA/homa-indicator.py` for Linux-like machines, 
or `<HOME>\HomA\homa-indicator.py` for Windows. As of August 30, 2023, 
**HomA** will not run under Windows without modification.

out) until a Playlist is opened.

- ***Rediscover now*** - Rediscovery happens every minute but you can force
immediate rediscovery with this option.
- ***Minimize*** - Duplicates the `Minimize` button at the bottom of the 
window. The **HomA** window is minimized with this option. 
- ***Suspend*** - Duplicates the `Suspend` button at the bottom of the 
window. All devices are powered off and the computer suspends. 
- ***Exit*** - **HomA** shuts down.

### *Edit* Dropdown Menu

- ***Timer 600 seconds*** - Run a timer and display large digit countdown.
Alarm sounds when timer ends. "600 seconds" changed in Preferences.
- ***Forget sudo password*** - If you had entered your sudo password
to control laptop display or reset Bluetooth you can use this option to
"forget" the password. That said, it is automatically encrypted and
reused on the next boot so you don't have to reenter it.
